**p6**
"What I “discovered” was that happiness is not something that happens. It is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person."

Health, beauty, money, or power. These are the things that supposed to make us feel happy. If we have most, if not all of that can we finally be happy. However, I always think those things to be the effect rather than the cause. 

For me, happiness is mundane. It's not something we eagerly seek, but rather it's something we already and always have. In an ever turbulent life full of ups and downs, when you are wise enough to always find that small space where you can breathe with ease, to always find a moment of respite. This, I think, is when I feel the happiest. Or at least, this is when I feel okay.


**p6**
"It is by being fully involved with every detail of our lives, whether good or bad, that we find happiness, not by trying to look for it directly."

Joy and sorrow is going to keep on happening around us. You can't have a life full of joy only, and likewise it's impossible to have a life of only sorrow. The ability to keep on going despite all of it is the strength I wish to have.


**p11**
"Yet we have all experienced times when, instead of being buffeted by anonymous forces, we do feel in control of our actions, masters of our own fate."

This is the moment that I said previously as a moment of respite. In the midst of whatever is happening around us, when we can be wise enough to notice our privilege to have enough control is when we can find that moment of respite. We always have a choice to do what we need to do. And to control ourselves to realize this truth and commit to action is when we understand how mundane life actually is.


**p11**
"The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile."

The keyword here is "voluntary effort." It's less about how difficult the task is because when you are unwilling, you will have a hard time to keep on going. However, when you are willing, then the difficulties will be worthwhile.


**p11**
"Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life \[…]"

Life is at its most unpleasant when we are helpless. The moment where you realize that you don't have control can lead to despair. Although, I don't think it's wise to be a control freak either. But to have enough control, a power to make a choice and to commit on doing it can give us a sense that we have a say in our life. That we don't take life for granted and we are willing to live and be alive by making our choice and be responsible to it.


**p16**
"Everything we experience—joy or pain, interest or boredom—is represented in the mind as information. If we are able to control this information, we can decide what our lives will be like."

Again, the power to choose. It's not about being apathetic when sorrows happen, or cautious when good things happen, but rather an understanding and acceptance that these things do happen. There will always be circumstances, and they can happen however they like. But we always have a choice to do what is right and appropriate thing to do.


**p20**
"Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the obstacles to fulfillment."

Whatever happens, accept that it happened, and understand that you have the power, right, and privilege to do what is right.


**p22**
"How we feel about ourselves, the joy we get from living, ultimately depend directly on how the mind filters and interprets everyday experiences. Whether we are happy depends on inner harmony, not on the controls we are able to exert over the great forces of the universe."

We can control the choices we make and the action we do, but don't ever hope that we could ever exert control over what can happen in the universe. The world is utterly indifferent and it doesn't answer to our convenience.


**p22**
"For the majority of people on this earth, life goals are simple: to survive, to leave children who will in turn survive, and, if possible, to do so with a certain amount of comfort and dignity."

"But as soon as these basic problems of survival are solved, merely having enough food and a comfortable shelter is no longer sufficient to make people content."

"With affluence and power come escalating expectations \[…]"

"The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present."

The simplest of desire of mankind is to survive. However, once we do, it's inevitable for us to desiring even more. I think it's good to always have desire as long as we enjoy the challenge. But it becomes a problem when our endless desire becomes a blight for our joy in the present moments. That the feeling of constant dissatisfaction makes us incapable of noticing the good things of today.


**p25**
"\[…] individuals have found ways to escape it. \[…] regardless of their material conditions, have been able to improve the quality of their lives \[…] "

"Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live."

Personally, this is the state of being that I wish to have. Even when I don't have much, even when things aren't going my ways, I want to have the understanding that I can choose which way to go in life, and be content because of it.


**p40**
"To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments."

"To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments."

Basically autonomy. Relying on oneself more than any external factors. That what we end up doing and our choices are more important than any circumstances that may happen. To be self-sufficient within one's self and being in order to not only stay alive, but also provide meaning to one's works.


**p42**
"The only authority many people trust today is instinct. If something feels good, if it is natural and spontaneous, then it must be right. But when we follow the suggestions of genetic and social instructions without question we relinquish the control of consciousness and become helpless playthings of impersonal forces."

It's easy to think when we find ourselves doing something and it feels natural, then we conclude that it's the "right" thing to do. I don't think I can fully dispute this point like the author does. However, I do agree that if we follow this instincts blindly and we abandon our conscious effort to have a question, then I don't think it's the right thing to do.

I think we must be conscious in whatever we are doing. Yes, some activities may start from a habit and we no longer have to think while we are doing it. But at least, we have to be conscious that we *choose* to do said habits.


**p47**
"This is not to say that we should abandon every goal endorsed by society; rather, it means that, in addition to or instead of the goals others use to bribe us with, we develop a set of our own."

Society can impose us with which desire we *should* have according to whatever standard is set. Understand that it's possible for make you adjust to their demand without you knowing it consciously. A home appliance brand can tell you that you "definitely" need this new TV to enhance your life and make you "happier." But this couldn't be further than the truth.

It's not to say that we should ignore any external forces. But understand that these kind of manipulation is totally possible. Using your reason, let yourself make an informed and wise decision.


**p47**
"Instead of forever straining for the tantalizing prize dangled just out of reach, one begins to harvest the genuine rewards of living."

As we live, understand that we don't have to allow ourselves to be happy only in the future and not today. It's not to say that we chase for instant gratification every time, but rather it's totally okay for us to breathe and be happy today. It's okay for us to experience life as it is going and be content with it.
