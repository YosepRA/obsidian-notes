**p13**
"Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand."

*- Thomas Carlyle*

When I think about the past, I see regrets. When I dream about the future, I see dread. It is so easy to forget that I live in the NOW, not yesterday or tomorrow. What I can do today is the only thing that I can do. 

I ought to remember that what truly matters is the works that I'm willing to put in today. Not the works that I've done in the past, or the works that I may or may not do in the future. Today, today, and only today.


**p13**
"\[â€¦] the best possible way to prepare for tomorrow is to concentrate with all your intelligence, all your enthusiasm, on doing today's work superbly today."

The only way to prepare for a better tomorrow is to do our best for today. Concentrate with all of your intelligence and resources to do today's work superbly today.


**p13**
"Give us this day our daily bread."

Even as a follower of Christ, I always forget that I should only ask about today's bread. Not the bread that I had yesterday, or the bread that I will have tomorrow. Only the bread for today so that I can live.


**p13**
'Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.'

*[Matthew 6:34](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.6.34)*

Again, another words of Jesus that I've ignored all of my life. Don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. Today already has its own troubles for us to take care of.
