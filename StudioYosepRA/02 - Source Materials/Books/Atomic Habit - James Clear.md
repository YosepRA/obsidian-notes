"A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically."

"\[…] changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years."

Don't underestimate small habits. Just like sands form into a hill, so is small habits form an orderly life.
