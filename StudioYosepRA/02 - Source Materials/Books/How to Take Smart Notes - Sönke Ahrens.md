**p9**
"A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together _in your head_ and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas."

Having a clear structure to everyday life is a blessing in itself. To not have to spend effort in deciding what to do at a certain time often frees me from the headache of conjuring motivation to do some works. It's because it's 8:00 AM, so it's a given for me to start studying or working on a project. It hasn't been a thing that I can apply consistently in my daily life, but I'm working on it.


**p9**
"Having a clear structure to work _in_ is completely different from making plans _about_ something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure _on yourself_; it makes you inflexible."

Relating to the previous point, I wholeheartedly agree with this point. People often say that setting up goals is the most important thing to do to have direction and purpose in life. I'm not saying that this isn't true, but rather I believe it's a bit inaccurate.

It's true that setting up plans for today can give direction for the activities one do. But at the same time, it imposes constraint to how one should spend the day. Studying and building are often open-ended business. They may have a clear goal to the eye, but in practice, they are rarely conclusive. There will always be loose ends, there will always be more questions, and there will always be a feeling that it's not finished yet. Moreover, if you set a goal to finish a chapter of a book or a feature of a software, and yet you haven't quite finish it yet because you haven't quite understand what that book's chapter was talking about, or there were still bugs in the feature which you built today.

Everything about it, and I believe life in general, is open-ended by nature. It's good to make a plan. But if you impose it as a iron-fist rules, then it becomes a prison that limits you from finding the detour of life.


**p9**
"The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward."

It has always been difficult for me to hit the balance between having a purposeful day, and yet still welcome the "surprises" that may come during it. I tried to make a plan for the day. But it's either become a constraint for me to ignore any pleasant surprises in favor to remain focus on the goal that I set to finish on that day.

Yes. I need a system as to where insight and new ideas become the driving forces that push my daily life.


**p18**
"Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand."

In the last few paragraphs prior to this sentence, the book tells me about how *Getting Things Done* by David Allen relates to the content of *How to Take Smart Notes.* I haven't read GTD (short of *Getting Things Done*), but apparently according to Ahrens, GTD is about collecting the things that needed to be done in one place, then process it in a standardized way. Ahrens then explains where he agrees with Allen, and where he isn't.

One of the point in GTD is that we can't focus on the task at hand, the things that needed to be done right here and now, is because there is a lingering thoughts in the back of our mind. The things that haven't been taken care of, and things that are put in the backburner of our mind since forever. It's one of the reason why we can't focus on the task at hand. Allen offers an idea that taking care of these little things will enable us to focus on the task at hand.

Then Ahrens agrees with Allen that a system which one can trust, an understanding that everything will be taken care of, will our brain let go and let us focus on the task at hand.

It's needless to say that I have a lot of weighing thoughts in my mind. Perhaps, by finding a suitable system for me to work on daily basis can help me to navigate through life.


**p22**
"He soon developed new categories of these notes. He realised that one idea, one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from. So he started to think about how one idea could relate and contribute to different contexts."

Talking about Niklas Luhmann, German sociologist and philosopher, in his early days when he was formulating a way of writing notes.

The relation between different field of knowledge is exhilaratingly vast to me. Every bit of knowledge never stand on isolation. They are always related to prior knowledge that one knows, then connections will form between seemingly unrelated topics to produce a new thought and idea.

I understood this insight quite early in life. Albeit, I haven't utilized this wisdom all that much to this day. But what I want to say is that I don't like the idea of mastering a field of knowledge means that one can only confine themselves in that particular field. Yes, it's important to get our focus right and set a certain boundaries to keep our track. But it's also as important for us to not get confined and discourage ourselves to explore other field to gain a new perspective of the whole picture.

That's why despite my desire to be a master in computer science, which ultimately leads to engineering, I'm also interested in art, music, and agriculture to name a few. With the vast amount of knowledge that is in front of me, I often lament of how short my life is, and how I've wasted it all this time. That's why I want to change. This book, *How to Take Smart Notes*, shall be my first step to dedicate my life to gaining knowledge.


**p27**
"If we work in an environment that is flexible enough to accommodate our work rhythm, we don’t need to struggle with resistance."

Emphasizing on the point made in one of *p9* note, having a flexible enough system as to allow new insights to grow as we work is important to me. Because I feel that the detours of thoughts were often the fun one. Following its trail and where it leads can bring enjoyment to my work. And that leads to a sensation that working is fun because I feel less resistance than when I work solely to achieve a set upon goal.

But again, this doesn't mean that I undermine the same importance held by a focused work, where I can't afford to divert from the task at hand. Haha, I guess I still don't know where to draw a line. But my point stood. Whenever I heed on the detours, the work has often been more fun than when I follow a strict line.

To build a system where there is less resistance for me, to use less willpower for me to start working is the reason why I read this book.


**p27**
"It is the way Luhmann and his slip-box worked together that allowed him to move freely and flexibly between different tasks and levels of thinking."

I always find it good to not only have one project to work on. Because often, I would hit a block on one project. And because I don't have anything else to do, I would keep on banging my head on this block, hoping that somehow I could find a solution.

It's not a coincidence that the solution often occurs when we are *not* working on said problems. I would often find a solution when I lay listlessly on my bed, when I take cold drenching shower on my head, or when I clean my room. It's the idleness of this activities that often leads me to a solution to a problem. 

But not only that, I would also find it refreshing to do something else entirely when I encounter a frustrating problem. It can either be reading a book about software development, a side project, or when I doodle an illustration. The point is that it often helps me to have more than one productive activities at hand. It doesn't have to be related to the main project, but it can take enough mental knowledge for me to switch focus on a different project and/or topic altogether. Then when I'm tired with the alternatives, I can go back to the main project with flushed out thoughts and often new insights to the problem.

Although it can be tricky to manage when the main projects often have deadlines. And this way of jumping between context can also be assumed as a form of escapism, of running away from the problem. I also need to find a good balance here because it's proven to be helpful to me already.


**The Slip-box Manual - p31**

1. *Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read.*
2. *Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side. These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.*   
   Just like what I do here. I read the book, if I find an interesting passages, I would quote it and explain it in my own words.
3. *He would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper.*
   If I find an interesting connections between different points in the book notes, then I would expand the thoughts in its own note while referencing the book note.
4. *More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes.*
   It's natural for these notes to be connected to each other. That's the point. It's about building connections and form a chain of notes. This way, perhaps we can track our notes back and write a new note from the ideas that may surface.
5. *The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic.*
   This is probably the entry point of the big topics, or topics that is often mentioned that it formed a big web of connection, such as "Software Development" or "Agriculture". Organized in such a way that the notes listed here will lead to different chain of notes with their own chain of thoughts.


**p36**
"Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have."
"If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down."

If you need to remember about something, write it down. Always. And it's all the truer for studying. Only by writing that you implant the idea within your head. Because while you are writing, you are also *thinking.* 

There is no way you can form sentences unconsciously and be done with it. You must think it through, it has to go through your brain's synapses, so that what you are writing makes sense. Because sometimes in the future, you, and perhaps other people, will read it. You don't want to read a text that is not properly put out. Mind you, I didn't say "well-written". We are not trying to write Shakespearean prose here. As long as the text can be read easily, then it's a pass.

That being said, to understand better of what I'm reading in all books, that's why I decided to pick up on this book. And this book is all about writing, thinking, and recording our thoughts. Sure, writing is a time-consuming work, and it doesn't sound as flashy as "speed-reading". But it's worth it. Simple as that.


**Writing a paper step-by-step - p40**

1. *Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind.*
   It's like you always carry a notebook whenever you go out. If you find something that catch your attention, write it down. It's not supposed to be refined, but rather it serves as a reminder, an idea that you should develop later on to a permanent note.
2. *Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content.*
   Just like what I'm doing here in this note. I'm catching the points in the book (or any source material), then I explain it with my own words, as best as how I understand it. Keep it very short and concise. If you want to expand it further, it's better to write it as a permanent note. 
3. *Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.*
   This is the main flesh of the note-taking habit. As stated above, it's recommended to go through the little notes that you've written throughout the day, and write a permanent note based on the connections that you may find before you forget what you were trying to say. So far, I've been writing permanent notes whenever I need to expand on a certain topic. However, I agree that I should visit the rough notes daily and think through its connections, contradictions, or corrections.
4. *Add your new permanent notes to the slip box by \[...] adding links to related notes.*
   It's time to make connections. Since I'm using Obsidian, I can utilize the backlink feature. The purpose for this is so that we can trace back our thoughts for each note. If a note is an expansion of idea of a certain other note, then link them up together.
5. *Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise.*
   If you are about to write a paper, work through these notes from bottom-up. Starting from the most basic topics, pick up a note, and read through the other notes that are connected by it. Question it, think about it, and develop it even further by filling up the holes in your argument and discarding the irrelevant past thoughts. 
   Follow the thoughts that lead you to more insights. If you find an interesting idea, don't cling to the old one and explore your new idea further. Because that's where you will think more and write more notes.
6. *After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. Your topic is now based on* what you have, *not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide.*
   Now you have a place to start because of what you already have, instead of what you are about to read. Collect the ideas, think it through, question it, discard the redundant parts, and develop it further.
7. *Turn your notes into a rough draft. Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript.* Translate *them into something coherent.*
   Using the notes that you have collected so far, turn it into a rough draft. This is where you arrange your seemingly messy notes into something more coherent and has a structure of a paper or book.
8. *Edit and proofread your manuscript.*
   Check it again for typos and fixes. This is the refining stage.

**p45**
"In truth, it is highly unlikely that every text you read will contain exactly the information you looked for and nothing else."
"We constantly encounter interesting ideas along the way and only a fraction of them are useful \[...]"

Whenever we start reading a book, it's easy for us to expect that the book will have information that we seek. However, there is no guarantee that to be true. Perhaps the book's content only have a bit of information that you need, and the rest are unrelated to you. Truly, this is a bit of a shame because we spend time and effort to read the book. And if it ends up with unnecessary information, it's easy to feel that we have wasted our time.

That's why it's better to make best use of every book that we read by taking notes and follow the trail of ideas that surface itself as you read it.


**The Tool Box - p47**

1. *You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head.*
   Do you have a wild idea popping up on your brain once you see that interesting ice cream banner down the street? Write it down. Have something to write these ideas on. It can be a notebook, napkin, or an app. It must be simple because we're only using it for random, undeveloped ideas that are going to be either developed further or thrown away.
2. *Reference system. To collect the references (duh) and the notes you take during your reading.*
   References to source materials (books, articles, video tutorials) that you can track back, and notes that you've written based on its content.
3. *The slip-box.*
4. *Finally, the editor*


**p55**
"The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used as an archive for notes – or worse: a graveyard for thoughts."

The tool is only as good as our understanding of it. If we don't know what it does and how it can help us in our works, then they nothing but an unnecessary layer of abstraction that will only distract us from the real work.

Slip box, if not used correctly, can end up as a simple archive for notes, or worse; a graveyard for thoughts. If we never use it to study our past thoughts, it will only lie there untouched and collecting dusts.

Therefore, understand how these tools work. Then utilize them as best as you know how.


**p65**
"Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published."

It's easy to make a mistake when writing notes. I mean, we all know how to take notes ourselves, right? Underline it, write something on a margin, or even write an excerpt on a different page. We know how to spot an interesting line and explain it in our words. But if that's only what it takes, then we would be prone of writing notes *indiscriminately.* We would write about everything, and treat everything just like our regular note, notes that are not too insightful and the ones that are actually insightful and worth further exploration.

Therefore, make a separation between rough and permanent notes. Rough notes are those that you write on a wimp, and permanent notes are the ones you would want to write as if you are going to publish it. Therefore basically, you should do your best in writing your permanent notes. Why? Because not only will you publish it, therefore people will read it, but you would also *revisit* these notes later in the future. Ask your future self whether he wants to read a scribble or a well-thought out essays? Yes, you have the answer.

That's why, put more effort in writing your permanent notes. Your future self (and other people) will thank you for it.


**p65**
"Even though the slip-box, being organized bottom-up, does not face the trade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can lose its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately. It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a _critical mass_, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled."

Restating from the previous point. Writing notes that have qualities to be published is crucial in order for us to use the slip-box properly. If we put our best in our writing, we will then have the tendency to honor these thoughts that we wrote. Over time, we will build up what Mr. Ahrens call *critical mass.*


**Three Types of Notes - p65**

1. *Fleeting notes*
   Rough notes. The ones you write on your notebook while you are on the road. Do you find that billboard interesting? Write it down. Don't elaborate too much because these notes can be thrown away after a few days.
2. *Permanent notes*
   The real meat. This is where you put your best effort to write your notes. Pick up interesting thoughts from your fleeting notes, then write a note worthy of being published and shared with others. These notes will then enter your slip-box and it will stay with you forever.
3. *Project notes*
   Notes related to one particular project. Perhaps, it's the same as what I'm writing here as I write notes related to this book. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived once finished.


**Typical Mistakes when Writing Notes - p65**

1. *Adhering to the advice of keeping a scientific journal*
   This is where you make a mistake to write about everything. The curiosity itself isn't wrong, but our attitude towards these notes may become problematic later on. Since we write these notes out of sudden curiosity, then it will be hard to put enough quality to it. Therefore, we will end up with a cluster mess of notes containing both the bad ideas and great ideas worth further exploration hidden beneath it. 
   
   This way, it's easy to end up with a lot of notebooks filled with interesting thoughts. But we will end up having a hard time to revisit these notes because we *think* these are just "random notes" not worth further exploration. Even if we do, we would still find it hard to navigate through all of these papers and build meaningful connection between it all.
2. *Collect notes only related to specific project*
   It makes sense to read books that may come up to your exams or need in your next project. But the disadvantage is that you have to *start over* after each project, and cut off all other promising ideas that may appear. Therefore, those branching thoughts and ideas may be lost after you finish one particular project.
   
   Even if you find a way to list out these ideas, you will quickly realize that tracking all of these ideas to be a chore. Worst of all, you will end up with a bunch of "unfinished project". If that's not a drag to your motivation, then what is?
   
   Most importantly, without a permanent reservoir of ideas, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over a longer period of time because you are restricting yourself to the *length* of your project or the *capacity* of your memory, which is a meager thing to rely on, honestly.
3. *Treat all notes as fleeting ones*
   Fleeting notes are supposed to be quick notes that you write when you catch a sudden idea. You may catch it when you are running errands or even when you walk down the park. These notes are not elaborate enough and they only serve as a simple reminder. 
   
   That's why it's important to revisit these notes later in the day and elaborate more about your findings to turn it into permanent notes. Because there is no guarantee that you will remember the context of said notes tomorrow morning because it will likely appear banal as you have forgotten the context of why you wrote it in the first place.


**p76**

"To develop a good question to write about \[…] one must already have put some thought into a topic. \[…] to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic. \[…] decision to read something and not something else is rooted in prior understanding, and that didn't come out of thin air."

"Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours."

Again, nothing is ever start from scratch. Even the decision to pick out a topic for an essay can only come from your prior experience and knowledge. And the depth of your decision can only be achieved if you have read quite a number of books, and certainly not only on one topic too.

Every intellectual endeavors start from what you already know, whether you like it or not. And what you are building right now will then serve as the foundation for your next project to come.


**p81**

"There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about."

"If you on the other hand develop your thinking in writing, open questions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possible topics to elaborate further in writing."

Writing, or most creative activities, is rarely a linear process, but rather a circular one. It's not by following steps of procedure can one produce a writing that is at least satisfying to work with. Whenever we follow a step-by-step guide, we often feel like we are fighting against the current as we think that we always have to start from scratch, from a blank page. Not only that, we would have a difficult time choosing the topic for our writing. I mean, how can we come up with a topic if we don't know anything about it in the first place?

That's why instead of trying to always start from scratch, it will be more helpful to look back at our past experience. In this case, our past writings. Writing is not a linear process, but a circular one. Meaning you can always choose to base your current writing on your past ones. Continually so with your future writings as you should use your current one as its base.

Therefore, it's important to keep on accumulating your knowledge by writing it down. Because then, you don't have to think too much about your future project if you can always dig on your past ones.


**p84**
"Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop."

Deliberately choosing to reward myself with something nice whenever I finish doing a difficult activity always feel superficial and cheap to me. It was similar to a feeling of giving my dogs treats whenever he put his paws on my hand. The dog may not know it, but I know it that it's superficial treats that I've carefully crafted to incite a certain desired behavior. Because I know it, I can clearly see that these rewards are superficial. To the point where I feel even more apathetic than usual.


**p84**

"\[…] focusing on one thing: Creating satisfying, repeatable experiences with sports."

"\[…] discover something that gives them a good experience that they would like to have again."

The reward of good habits should lie on the work itself, not in whatever we deliberately attach at the end of the stick. This way, we would feel motivated to do the work simply because we like doing it, and not because of any superficial reason such as cheap rewards.


**p84**

"Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, \[…]"

It's true that it's important to share our findings to other people. As an introvert, I've been struggling with this since forever. I need to understand that I don't seek to be humiliated because of what I do, but rather a simple desire to share and connect with other people, which is something I deserve to have as a living human being.


**p89**

"The linear model of academic writing comes with very few feedback opportunities, \[…]"

"Following a circular approach, \[…] give you the chance to improve your work while you are working on it. \[…] increasing the number of opportunities to learn, but also to be able to correct the mistakes we inevitably make."

Since feedbacks are crucial in growth, it will be great if there is a studying system that can afford a consistent feedback that comes in bite-sized chunks. The linear model of academic writing often can only provide feedbacks at the end of the process. And it comes in one go, too much for us to handle all at once. The circular model, on the other hand, could provide a consistent bite-sized chunks of feedbacks as we work. That way, opportunities to learn will also grow as we can continually adjust our headings according to what we are learning at the moment.


**p89**

"We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words."

What matters is not the amount of books one has read, but whether one can truly understand what they are reading, and they can explain it in their own words. Ideally, for many times to come.


**p92**

"\[…] it is obvious that we are surrounded by more sources of distraction and less opportunities to train our attention spans."

It's an ever faster and interconnected world where new information flows into our brain at every millisecond we give them an opportunity to. It's a ruthlessly fast world where everything is judged by how fast you can provided information to consumers. I've even heard of an idea in a field of marketing that if your ads couldn't catch consumers' attention within 5 seconds, you lose it.


**p92**

"Multitask – for some, it is one of the most important skills to cope with today’s informational overload."

"While those who multitasked _felt_ more productive, their productivity actually decreased – a lot."

Multitasking is seen as a necessary skill in today's economy. If you can't produce many good works at the same time, you are not good enough. It has always been difficult for me to multitask. But on the other hand, it's always easy for me to focus on one task. When I juggle between different tasks, I found myself easily overwhelmed by each of its requirements. And sadly, many of my employers had seen this as a weakness of mine. Although "somehow", my ability to focus on one task has saved me multiple times from silly mistakes, and also somehow saved me from the scrutiny of my inability to juggle between tasks.

To put it bluntly, I think multitasking is a misunderstood criteria of productivity that is hurting the quality of work and experience of working in to today's age.


**p92**

"Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things."

It's a common misunderstanding to think that multitasking is focusing on multiple tasks at the same time. Nobody can do that, ever. We are not built for that way of working. What we really think about multitasking is the constant switching between context of different tasks.

Talking about an example of texting and driving at the same time. Could you truly put your focus on these two different tasks at the same time? Of course not. Once you shift your brain to texting, you will inevitably neglect your focus on driving altogether. Likewise, when you switch your focus on driving, you wouldn't be able to form proper sentences for your text. 

It's the constant switching of context that will inevitable hurt you and the quality of works and perhaps your sanity too. What is the difference between texting while driving, and working on your spreadsheet report while listening to the important project briefing from your manager? Right, none. Multitask is not only a lie, but it works against your best intention.
