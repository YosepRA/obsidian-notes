"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you start to think, _Man this hurts, I can’t take it anymore._ The _hurt_ part is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand any more is up to the runner himself."

Pain is inevitable. There is no two ways about it. In the end, it's our choice to keep on walking or not. And it's our choice to suffer through pain or not.

"\[…] to let the exhilaration I feel at the end of each run carry over to the next day. This is the same sort of tack I find necessary when writing a novel. I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more."

I think it's a good thing to stop where you can continue the next day. It's not about doing little things today so that we can have more to work tomorrow, but rather choose to end the day in a manner of which we can continue straight away once we go back to work.

"Those kinds of memories—unpretentious, commonplace. But for me, they’re all meaningful and valuable."
