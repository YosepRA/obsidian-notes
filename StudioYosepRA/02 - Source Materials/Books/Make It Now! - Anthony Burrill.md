"He taught me to be continually positive, always inquisitive and eager to seek out new experiences. These are the qualities that I believe are the key to creativity."

What comes before creativity is a simple sense of curiosity. The eagerness to know about the world around you, to capture the moment of an old lady crossing the red light with her grandson, to keep that interesting looking pamphlet which you received from a kind bakery employee, or to write down what a nice waitress say when he delivers your ordered food.

A desire to know more is justice itself. Without it, the seeds of apathy will grow. And as someone who is apathetic, while I know it has its benefits such as I'm not easily swayed by the majority's narratives. However, when it comes to creativity, apathy is an adversary. Without curiosity, it's hard or nigh impossible to grow, as a person, let alone as a creative individual.

"I was ridiculously shy and I didn’t like ringing people up on the phone, so it was hard for me to get my work out there. I started off by making little photocopied books and postcards to send to people, finding ways of producing unique printed material that would stand out."

"You shouldn’t feel that you have to be a certain type to succeed, the main thing is to be driven and believe in what you are doing. Be consistent with your message and don’t worry too much about trying to fit in."

There is a door for those who are willing to seek for it. Me being an introvert is sure to be difficult, but it's not the reason nor excuse for me to not spend an effort to find a way through. Let God lead you, ask for a way, and He will give you one.
