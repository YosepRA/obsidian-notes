"He taught me to be continually positive, always inquisitive and eager to seek out new experiences. These are the qualities that I believe are the key to creativity."

What comes before creativity is a simple sense of curiosity. The eagerness to know about the world around you, to capture the moment of an old lady crossing the red light with her grandson, to keep that interesting looking pamphlet which you received from a kind bakery employee, or to write down what a nice waitress say when he delivers your ordered food.

A desire to know more is justice itself. Without it, the seeds of apathy will grow. And as someone who is apathetic, while I know it has its benefits such as I'm not easily swayed by the majority's narratives. However, when it comes to creativity, apathy is an adversary. Without curiosity, it's hard or nigh impossible to grow, as a person, let alone as a creative individual.
