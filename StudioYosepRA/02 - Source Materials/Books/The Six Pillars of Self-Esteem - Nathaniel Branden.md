"Self-esteem, fully realized, is the experience that we are appropriate to life and to the requirements of life.
1. Confidence in our ability to think, confidence in our ability to cope with the basic challenges of life.
2. Confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being worthy, deserving, entitled to assert our needs and wants, achieve our values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts."

The confidence that we have what it takes to live a life, and the confidence of our rights to be happy.


**p4**
"To trust one's mind and to know that one is worthy of happiness is the essence of self-esteem. The power of this conviction about oneself lies in the fact that it is more than a judgement or a feeling. It is a motivator. It inspires behavior."

I need to stick this up somewhere because this sentence can become the cue whenever I feel lost in my depressive thoughts.


**p4**
"There is a continuous feedback loop between our actions in the world and our self-esteem. The level of our self-esteem influences how we act, and how we act influences the level of our self-esteem."

Understand the theory, then practice it. It's a simple wisdom, yet I seem to not understand it enough. The more you do, the more you understand. The more you understand, the more likely you will do things that enhances those understanding. Before you know it, it has become part of your mind and body.


**p4**
"If I trust my mind and judgement, I am more likely to operate as a thinking being. Exercising my ability to think, bringing appropriate awareness to my activities, my life works better."

We have our mind, our brain. Use it. When you use it, you will more likely to find a solution than when you spend your time in your sorrow. The more you use your mind, the more you operate as a thinking being. Which is a blessing which God has given to us all.


**p5**
"If I persevere, the likelihood is that I will succeed more often than I fail. If I don't, the likelihood is that I will fail more often than I succeed. Either way, my view of myself will be reinforced."

Whenever I watch football, I always love to say "those who shoots are those who scores." I mean, how can you score a goal if you don't shoot it first? 

It's funny because the very thing that I often say is happening to me. How can I accomplish anything if I never take the leap? How contradictory it is.


**p6**
"High self-esteem seeks the challenge and stimulation of worthwhile and demanding goals. Reaching such goals nurtures good self-esteem. Low self-esteem seeks safety of the familiar and undemanding. Confining oneself to the familiar and undemanding serves to weaken self-esteem."

Whenever I had the courage to try something difficult. And once I found myself succeeding in the challenge which I set myself, I feel a sense of accomplishment that cannot be described by words. After that, doing the same difficult thing is never as difficult as my first attempt, not even as difficult as I once feared it to be.

The more I challenge myself and the more I be courageous in the face of such challenges, I should have had more answers and wisdoms rather than doubt and worries like I do now. I'm supposed to understand this point already, and yet I willingly chose to remain in my safety.


**p8**
"There is no greater barrier to romantic happiness than the fear that I am undeserving of love and that my destiny is to be hurt. Such fears give birth to self-fulfilling prophecies."

"When we 'know' we are doomed, we behave in ways to make reality conform to our 'knowledge.' \[…] Since our 'knowledge' is not to be doubted or questioned, it is the facts that have to be altered: hence self-sabotage."

When you think of undeserving of love (or anything, really), then how can you expect yourself to be loved? Self-fulfilling prophecies. If we believe in anything and we continually repeat it both in our mind and how we act, these behaviors will turn your seemingly unconscious thoughts into reality.


**p10**
"The tragedy of many people's lives is that, given a choice between being 'right' and having an opportunity to be happy, they invariably choose being 'right.' That is the one ultimate satisfaction they allow themselves."

It is truly a tragedy. We feel better to be proven right than being happy. If I think I'm insufficient to face life challenges, then the very thing I believe turns out to be reality, then I feel justified for being right. "Oh, I've always know this is going to happen anyway." We mask our disappointment and sadness with a sense of relief for being right.


**p11**
"I may read books on the subject, participate in seminars, attend lectures, or enter psychotherapy with the announced aim of being happy *in the future.* But not now; not today. The possibility of happiness in the present is too terrifyingly immediate."

It's always bread and jam tomorrow, never bread and jam today. It's always in the future will we feel happy. But not today. Being happy today is wrong, for whatever reason.

When I believe that I don't deserve the good things in life, I'd often become allergic towards happiness. Whenever I feel happy, I feel something is wrong. It's wrong because it goes against what is "right" in my mind. And what is right at this moment is that I don't deserve to have the good things in life. However, I do deserve the good things later in the future. No matter when it exactly is, but surely in the future. Somewhere, whenever.

Again, it's a twisted believe and I'm working on it. And sure, it takes more for me to pep talk myself out of it with some cheesy line such as "You can do it" or "You deserve to be happy." I need action more than talks. For action speaks louder for my convictions than whatever comes out of my mouth.


**p11**
"What is required for many of us, paradoxical though it may sound, is the courage to tolerate happiness without self-sabotage."

Yes, this is exactly it. Have the courage to be happy and accept what the good thing may come to you. It's okay to be happy right here and now. There is no need to feel wrong or undeserving for it.


**p14**
"When we doubt our minds, we tend to discount its products. If we fear intellectual self-assertiveness, perhaps associating it with loss of love, we mute our intelligence. We dread being visible; so we make ourselves invisible, then suffer because no one sees us."

One of the worst feelings to have is when we doubt our own minds. Whenever an idea pops up in my brain, I would ask myself "Who are you to have an idea? Oh, do you really think your idea is good? How cute."

When I continue to undermine or disrespect my own mind, it's inevitable that I will grow and see myself as unreliable. Why would I rely on my own brain who can only spout nonsense, while the fact is it's my fault that I continue to not acknowledge the products of my brain.


**p14**
"Self-esteem creates a set of implicit expectations about what is possible and appropriate to us. These expectations tend to generate the actions that turn them into realities. And the realities confirm and strengthen the original beliefs. Self-esteem, high or low, tends to be a generator of self-fulfilling prophecies."

Talking about self-fulfilling prophecies. That which we believe and have conviction on *is* our reality. If we convict ourselves to be someone who is incapable and insufficient to face life, then it shall become our reality.

How can we be something we think we are not? How can I be a capable and reliable person to myself if I genuinely believe that I'm not good enough for life on earth? There must be a fire when there is smoke. There must be a cause of an effect. There must be beliefs and convictions of an action.


**p14**
"What we make an effort to learn and what we achieve is based, at least in part, on what we think is possible and appropriate to us."

When we genuinely believe that something is possible, then it's a half-work done. The rest depends on your honest effort. 

I, for example, believe that being a good software engineer isn't outside of my reach. I never had the privilege to attend computer science college. However, I truly believe that I can reach a satisfying height for myself when it comes to mastering software engineering and computer science. 

I don't think I'm trapped in the hole of Dunning-Kruger effect either, because I truly understand how vast the world of software engineering is. So vast that I won't have enough time and energy to study and understand it all in my short life span.

My halted progress at this moment however is the result of my indecision and fear about life in general than my convictions about my abilities to pursuit this journey. Therefore. I pray that I could come in peace with myself and restart this journey with an earnest and clear heart. 


**p18**
"When self-esteem is low, \[…] We tend to be more influenced by the desire to avoid pain than to experience joy. Negatives have more power over us than positives. If we do not believe in ourselves, neither in our efficacy nor in our goodness, the universe is a frightening place."

Indeed. If you can't rely on yourself, the world is a frightening place. Without being able to rely on oneself, we would experience the true meaning of loneness, for there is literally no one there.

However, when you can rely on yourself, at least you will have yourself as your first ally in this world. Of course, as a Christian, my first and foremost ally is my Lord God in the form of His Spirit who resides within me and who is always with me all the time. But, to have one other ally in myself whom I can rely on to tackle life's challenges, it would simply be a bliss. It won't even be an exaggeration that if I have peace with God and myself, I could tackle whatever challenges this life may throw at me, as long as God wills it, of course.

I mean, wouldn't it be cool that in the face of a daunting task, I could just say "bring it on"?


**p20**
"When we have unconflicted self-esteem, joy is our motor, not fear. It is happiness that we wish to experience, not suffering that we wish to avoid. Our purpose is self-expression, not self-avoidance or self-justification. Our motive is not to 'prove' our worth but to live our possibilities."

"If my aim is to prove I am 'enough,' the project goes on to infinity, because the battle was already lost on the day I conceded the issue was debatable."

Why is it that we are often driven by our fear? Fear of being not good enough is the biggest fear for me. Whatever I do, I based it on this fear. I do what I do because I want to somehow "prove" something, to anyone else and to myself. Because I believed that once I proved that I'm good enough, I can feel at peace. While the reality, I never know how much amounts to "enough."

When my motivation of action is based on fear, it's hard for me to feel any joy from it. Even if I am able to build the most sophisticated app, if the motivation for it is to prove someone wrong, then I wouldn't be happy about this achievement. Heck, even if I use fear as my motivation, I don't think I could move that far anyway.

The joy of expression. This is something that I wish to learn more about. What does it mean to express my thoughts because I'm joyful of it and I wish to share it. Perhaps this way, then being a creative person won't be as hard as I am right now.


**p24**
"We need to know who we are and to be centered within ourselves. We need to know what matters to us; otherwise it is easy to be swept up and swept along by alien values, pursuing goals that do not nourish who we really are."

How easy life would be had I know who I am, what matters to me, and I accept myself as I am.

I thought I know how I am, what matters to me, and that I have accepted myself. But the struggles of life continues to push me down. I don't even know if I have the desire for life.
