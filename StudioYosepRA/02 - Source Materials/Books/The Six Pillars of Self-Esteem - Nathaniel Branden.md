"Self-esteem, fully realized, is the experience that we are appropriate to life and to the requirements of life.
1. Confidence in our ability to think, confidence in our ability to cope with the basic challenges of life.
2. Confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being worthy, deserving, entitled to assert our needs and wants, achieve our values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts."

The confidence that we have what it takes to live a life, and the confidence of our rights to be happy.

"To trust one's mind and to know that one is worthy of happiness is the essence of self-esteem. The power of this conviction about oneself lies in the fact that it is more than a judgement or a feeling. It is a motivator. It inspires behavior."

I need to stick this up somewhere because this sentence can become the cue whenever I feel lost in my depressive thoughts.


**p4**
"There is a continuous feedback loop between our actions in the world and our self-esteem. The level of our self-esteem influences how we act, and how we act influences the level of our self-esteem."

Understand the theory, then practice it. It's a simple wisdom, yet I seem to not understand it enough. The more you do, the more you understand. The more you understand, the more likely you will do things that enhances those understanding. Before you know it, it has become part of your mind and body.


**p4**
"If I trust my mind and judgement, I am more likely to operate as a thinking being. Exercising my ability to think, bringing appropriate awareness to my activities, my life works better."

We have our mind, our brain. Use it. When you use it, you will more likely to find a solution than when you spend your time in your sorrow. The more you use your mind, the more you operate as a thinking being. Which is a blessing which God has given to us all.

"If I persevere, the likelihood is that I will succeed more often than I fail. If I don't, the likelihood is that I will fail more often than I succeed. Either way, my view of myself will be reinforced."

Whenever I watch football, I always love to say "those who shoots are those who scores." I mean, how can you score a goal if you don't shoot it first? 

It's funny because the very thing that I often say is happening to me. How can I accomplish anything if I never take the leap? How contradictory it is.


**p6**
"High self-esteem seeks the challenge and stimulation of worthwhile and demanding goals. Reaching such goals nurtures good self-esteem. Low self-esteem seeks safety of the familiar and undemanding. Confining oneself to the familiar and undemanding serves to weaken self-esteem."

Whenever I had the courage to try something difficult. And once I found myself succeeding in the challenge which I set myself, I feel a sense of accomplishment that cannot be described by words. After that, doing the same difficult thing is never as difficult as my first attempt, not even as difficult as I once feared it to be.

The more I challenge myself and the more I be courageous in the face of such challenges, I should have had more answers and wisdoms rather than doubt and worries like I do now. I'm supposed to understand this point already, and yet I willingly chose to remain in my safety.
