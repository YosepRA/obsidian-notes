"Persona, who are we designing for?"

An important, often misunderstood, requirement of creating a graphic design. By creating a proper persona that is fitting to your project, it can lead you to your desired result.

One such example of persona, Kate, a 40 years-old online math teacher. She is married with two-kids and she needs a platform where she can do her job from her home in order for her to spend more time with her kids.

Then you create your designs according to your personas, then test it on real people who are close to your set persona. That would be ideal, of course. But personas keep your project from missing its target users.

"Making Components in Figma"

Components, pieces that you are going to use in many places in your project. Imagine buttons, navigation bar, and footer in your 100 artboards. What if you want change your button's color? Or footer text? Would you want to change it 100 times every time? Surely not! Use components, please.

"Copy and Paste components' properties."

Do you have an component in your design which you wish to copy its color, size, stroke style into yet one other component? Use the "Copy Properties" function from Edit â†’ Copy properties.
