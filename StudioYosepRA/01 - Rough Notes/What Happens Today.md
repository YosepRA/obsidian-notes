List of things that happened today to serve as a short record of ideas for writing daily blog.

- Social media addiction.
- The ease of feelings once I know who I am. Thus dedicating myself to walk the path.
- I realize once more how vast the amount of knowledge which I wish to attain.

- Simple creativity. I just want to create. I need no reason because this is what I do, and it is an inevitability for me.
- I really do need a blog site to initiate a habit to record (and share) my daily journey.

- Networking as an introvert.
- Deliberate practice. It is not as complicated as I thought it would. You see something you want to learn, and then you choose to study it, then that is the best example of deliberate practice. So perhaps, I have overthink about deliberate practice all this long.

- It's called "React Router app" now.

- A gap between design and implementation. Some elements in the mockup may appear bigger when implementing it in code. This is due to my inexperience in judging the size and space between different canvas sizes.

- Webpack `publicPath` problems. Incorrect interpretation of Webpack as a bundler of not only JavaScript files, but also other static files, such as CSS, images, and fonts. The output folder is for *all* static files, and not only JavaScript files.
