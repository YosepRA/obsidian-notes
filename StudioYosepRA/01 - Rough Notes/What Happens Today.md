- Social media addiction.
- The ease of feelings once I know who I am. Thus dedicating myself to walk the path.
- I realize once more how vast the amount of knowledge which I wish to attain.

- Simple creativity. I just want to create. I need no reason because this is what I do, and it is an inevitability for me.
- I really do need a blog site to initiate a habit to record (and share) my daily journey.

- Networking as an introvert.
- Deliberate practice. It is not as complicated as I thought it would. You see something you want to learn, and then you choose to study it, then that is the best example of deliberate practice. So perhaps, I have overthink about deliberate practice all this long.
