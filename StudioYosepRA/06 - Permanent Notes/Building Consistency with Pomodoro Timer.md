I slept on time, and yet I'm feeling sleepy this morning. Hmm, I can't blame it, I had a breakfast for today, which is something I rarely have. It was rather on the heavy side, hence why I'm feeling sleepy. Even now, I'm writing this note with both of my eyes closed. (Yes, I can type without looking at the keyboard.)

Yesterday, I returned to use Pomodoro timer in my workflow. I've had enough with working with spontaneity and waiting for myself to enter the flow state. It doesn't and never worked. I reapply the strict schedule of 25 minutes of work time and 5 minutes of rest. I want to commit myself in doing at least 6 rounds of Pomodoro every day, which amounts to 3 hours per day. It isn't much, but I'm getting there. These rounds should only be focused sessions to study and work on projects. I hope that it can come good for me to maintain consistency and to build up useful habits.

Although yes, honestly, because of my sleepiness, I feel lazy today. My heart is still split between trying to build consistency by studying using books, and continuing to build StudioYosepRA. I want to do the former because again, I want to rebuild consistent habit every day by getting my butt down and work on to think and write some code. While at the same time for the latter, I feel like I need to finish StudioYosepRA ASAP.

It has been a problem for me for so long now. I can choose to build StudioYosepRA, but the fire is vanished quickly whenever I start working on it. On the contrary, studying can help me maintain the fire a bit longer through consistent effort.

Yeah, I'm going round and round with it. I will continue on reading *You Don't Know JS* today, and I will use Pomodoro timer to achieve my 6 Pomodoro rounds for today. Thank you for reading, and have a good day.
