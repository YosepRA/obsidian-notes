"He (Jack Gilbert) told them that they must live their most creative lives as a means of fighting back against the ruthless furnace of this world."

I recently see creativity as an inevitability, meaning that it is not something I force into myself, but rather it is just simply who I am and how I choose to live. 

Jack Gilbert's idea of living one's most creative lives as a means to fight the cruel world is romantic, and somewhat endearing. We know how absurdly, ridiculously, and awfully cruel this world can be. To the point where pain is the clearest experience we would experience in our daily basis.

Pain and suffering is also an inevitability in this life. In a way, we must accept it. However, accepting as it is could lead us to despair, which is not the greatest feeling to have. We have an obligation to accept it, as in accepting it as part of life, but we also have the power and choice to *fight* it. And fighting through our creative prowess is one way to it.

"Most of all, though, he asked his students to be brave. Without bravery, he instructed, they would never be able to realize the vaulting scope of their own capacities. Without bravery, they would never know the world as richly as it longs to be known. Without bravery, their lives would remain small—far smaller than they probably wanted their lives to be."

Just one step of courage is often what we need to do the seemingly impossible task. Just one step of courage is often what need to experience life in its fullest. Just one step of courage is all we need to live a life we won't regret.

"\[…] when I refer to “creative living,” I am speaking more broadly. I’m talking about living a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear."

Wouldn't it be great if what drives you is your questions and wonder rather than your fear? You are no longer thinking about the outcome, but you simply wish to have your questions answered. And to get all of that, you are willing to walk the journey.

"\[…] as an adult, she finally had the perspective to appreciate the value of her own joy."

"She stopped feeling like she was nothing more than a consumer, nothing more than the sum of her daily obligations and duties."

As we grow older, so is our obligations. And even more so, we tend to forget what joy is. We are getting mobbed by our daily duties, and we take it as a matter of fact as it establishes as our routines.

Before we know it, it has become a cage to us, to conform to what is seen to be good by the masses, and ignore the voice of your heart. Alas, it all leads to one forgetting the time when they feel truly happy.

"Please note that my friend did not quit her job, did not sell her home, did not sever all her relationships and move to Toronto to study seventy hours a week with an exacting Olympic-level skating coach. And no, this story does not end with her winning any championship medals. It doesn’t have to. In fact, this story does not end at all, because Susan is still figure skating several mornings a week—simply because skating is still the best way for her to unfold a certain beauty and transcendence within her life that she cannot seem to access in any other manner. And she would like to spend as much time as possible in such a state of transcendence while she is still here on earth.

That’s all.

That’s what I call creative living."

We often demand a story to end well in the glory of the most high. However, the life of a creative is not that shallow.

Only by creative living do we realize the beauty of the world and ourselves. Only by creative living do we have access to those beauty. We don't particularly aim for glory, even though it is often the case for some. We do it just because we want to do it while we are still here on earth.

"I finally realized that my fear was boring. \[…] boring \[…] *because it was the same thing every day.*"

Have I ever thought that my fears are boring? Hmm... It makes me wonder. It really is an every day thing. It's like facing the same fear, which formed as a big black hound tied to a pole and barks to me in my imagination every day. I'm still scared of its barks every day. But have I ever wondered whether I'm bored with it? Perhaps, never.


**p29**
"Bravery means doing something scary.
Fearlessness means not even understanding what the word _scary_ means."

"_But you do not need your fear in the realm of creative expression._"

Bravery and courage isn't an absence of fear. It's an acceptance of fear that one is being fearful of something, and one chooses to continue on walking despite it. He chooses to not only accept his fears, but also to live together with it. Even more so to show himself that some of his fears are irrational.


**p39**
"Ideas are a disembodied, energetic life-form. \[…] Ideas are driven by a single impulse: to be made manifest. And the only way an idea can be made manifest in our world is through collaboration with a human partner."

I don't really care about where ideas come from. Some say that it came from the Muses, some other say that it came from a sparking connection within our brain based on our past experiences.

Again, I don't care that much as to debate over it. However, I know that it is not solely my own doing. I know for certain that there is a voice. The voice continues to talk to me about creating numerous things. It is always urging me, or even asks me for help, to make those ideas a reality.

From this view, I may have been leaning towards the Muses after all. And I'm okay with that. I believe in God and I know His voice. Therefore, it is not strange if said voices is just simply the voice of the Spirit.

Lastly, one thing I clearly know is that whenever I do listen to these voices, whenever I decide to help them and create their ideas, my heart is filled to the brim, and I feel the satisfaction of life in its purest form. Not because I gain something material from it, but rather a hollow place in my heart is just filled with something that it yearns for.
