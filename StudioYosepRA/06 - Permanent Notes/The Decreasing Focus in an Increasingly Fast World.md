It's an ever faster and interconnected world where new information flows into our brain at every millisecond we give them an opportunity to. It's a ruthlessly fast world where everything is judged by how fast you can provided information to consumers. I've even heard of an idea in a field of marketing that if your ads couldn't catch consumers' attention within 5 seconds, you will lose it.

Everyone wants to share something, everyone wants to sell something. And the way they compete in today's world is by how quick you can get your consumer's attention. So quick that 5 seconds is all you can afford. Now imagine if *all* information is catered towards this particular need of quick information delivery. Yes, you will get social media.

Social media has always been a place for everyone to share. But since everyone wants to say something and everyone wants to be heard, all of them compete in how succinct their information should be. That means social media users could read, theoretically, 12 bits of information every minute (assuming that every information takes 5 seconds to read). Surely this is a good thing, right? Since we can absorb more information, we can gain more wealth of knowledge and we can grow exponentially faster too. But alas, there is another side of truth in this story.

As we continue to live and consume information in this rapid flow of a river, we are becoming accustomed to how *short* of an information that we can consume. So short that it's becoming more and more difficult for people to read even 50 words worth of a paragraph. Subconsciously we may think, what is the purpose of reading longer information if all we have to do is pay attention for 5 seconds? Our brain is developing backward as it no longer need to maintain focus for longer than 5 seconds.

At the moment of writing, I'm also struggling with the same issue. Of course, I can still maintain my focus for way longer than the young ones these days once I entered the flow. Nonetheless, I'm starting to notice the decreasing of my ability to focus on my tasks. When I'm not in the flow, my attention is constantly looking for stimulation in a form of bite-sized information which I can easily get from random browsing, Twitter, and YouTube. And if I heed to this desire, it will be inevitable for me to spend at least 30 minutes stuck in this endless scroll of information. My intention to build a habit of writing notes is not only because I want to study better, but also to retrain my brain to focus on a single task.

Right now, I'm having a commitment to discard social media in my life, mainly Twitter. I'd still allow myself to use YouTube, but I'd only allow myself to use it solely for studying in working hours, and one hour of screen time in the night. When it comes to YouTube, I've also decided to not use YouTube Shorts ever again. I thought I've made myself clear back in the day that I utterly despise this short video form popularized by Tiktok. But before I know it, I indulged myself in this brevity of content, and unintentionally enjoy it.

It's a sad realization that I've also become a victim of this trend. Now that I've made myself a commitment to live as a lifelong learner, these short bits of information are no longer relevant in my life. I don't think it will be difficult for me to remove social media (Twitter) in my life, but I still need to be careful to not fall into the pit of YouTube. On the other hand, I would still need a channel of information to keep myself in touch with the world. A channel that is obviously much slower compared than social media. I already have my channel for software development and engineering fields, but I may need to resort to traditional news platform for the more general ones.

It's a commitment from me to combat the ever decreasing focus in my life. If you also notice that this rapid world is hurting your ability to work with focus, then I would recommend you to consider changing your mindset of information. That you don't need to know everything and understand everything that is happening in this world. Information overload is a real thing and it has hurt you and I all the same. 

Let's retrain our brain to do what it does best, which is to focus and pour all of its energy to produce invaluable works that is impossible to create without undivided focus.
