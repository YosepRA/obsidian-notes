It's the end of the day already. Today is good, very good. I found out about one particular behavior of JavaScript scope that corrects my understanding of a program that is run from top to bottom. After I woke up from my nap, I also took a jog for about 3 km, which is the rarest thing I would do ever. So yeah, today is good. But at the same time, I'm also depleted and void of energy.

There is a saying that willpower is a limited resource. On one part, I believe on it. But on the other hand, I don't want to be fooled by it. See, it's easy to mistake a depleted willpower with laziness. You may not feel like doing something at one point, and you can make an excuse that you don't have the willpower left in the tank. 

Oftentimes, when I don't feel like doing something that I need to do, it's only a matter of choosing to do it or not. As long as I choose to start doing it, then everything else carries on as naturally as a flowing water.

Now, that is the case for my afternoon activities. After I did my jog, I feel super depleted. Because it's something I haven't done in the longest time, I feel more exhausted than I usually am. Usually after I wake up from my nap, I would go straight to bath and go back to my desk to have a few more focused Pomodoro sessions. However today that I've replaced it with exercise, it feels heavy on me to go on and have a focused study session on my desk.

Although I must admit that it is far from impossible for me to go on and study even after this. At least, I want to believe that I can do it as long as I choose to walk and do it. Even after writing this short note, I feel like I can jump and do one study session. Probably more if somehow I find my flow there. Again, I don't think it's impossible for me to do it.

This may be a sign that I still have some willpower in my tank. Or perhaps, there was never a hard limit on willpower that we could use to push ourselves to start doing our works. I don't know because I have always been a lazy person. That being said, it's rare for me to push myself beyond my supposed limit.

This is the question I have about the limitation of willpower. And I can only answer it if I push myself to the limit. Because I want to believe that mankind in general are tougher than whatever they believe in. Whenever men think that they are at their limit, somehow there is a push from behind for us to keep on moving forward. Even as a lazy person such as myself, I can recall many occasions where I found strength when I need it most. As a believer, I believe that it's God's hands that works within me.

In the end, I'm still learning, and I shall forever learning. This small habits that I do recently, I want to continue to build on it. I admit that the volume and intensity aren't quite there yet, but I believe that these small building blocks matter more than pushing myself to death right from the get go. I pray to God, to my Lord Jesus Christ, that He will strengthen me and give me patience to continue on building and placing these small blocks in my life. And I hope for whoever is reading this note that you may have the same wisdom to consistently build on these building blocks as well. Thank you for reading.
