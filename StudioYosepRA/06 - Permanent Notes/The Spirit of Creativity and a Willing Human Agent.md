Have you ever wondered where do your ideas came from? How did you came into a great idea of your own that makes you feel jittery as if a thunder has struck the top of your head? Right after that is this intense desire and urge to make that idea a reality. Have you ever wondered where it came from, or *from whom* does it came from?

To be honest, I don't really care about the origin of ideas. Some people say that it is the Muses who speak with human. Yet some other say that ideas are a sparking connectivity between different experiences and memories of the past in which they clash and produce said ideas.

Again, I don't really care that much about it. I don't really care in a sense that I won't pull my hair over to debate over it. However, I do know that it is not solely my own doing. I know for certain that there is a voice. The voice continues to talk to me about creating numerous things. It is always urging me, or even asks me for help, to turn those ideas a reality.

From this view, I may have been leaning towards the Muses after all. And I'm okay with that. I believe in God and I know His voice. Therefore, it is not strange if said voices is just simply the voice of the Spirit and He leads me through the path of creativity for God to achieve His will.

Ultimately, one thing I clearly know is that whenever I do listen to these voices, whenever I decide to help them and create their ideas and I put my heart to build it, my heart is filled to the brim, and I feel the satisfaction of life in its purest form. Not because I gain something material from it, but rather a hollow place in my heart is just filled with something that it yearns for. It's like when you are parched and you have a sip of fresh water. This water is the most delicious one that you ever had. This is what it feels like when I listen to the Spirit and be a willing human agent for His will.

A partnership between the Spirit of creativity and a willing human agent. How romantic is it? Although I don't believe the Spirit doesn't have power to create on His own since God is omnipotent after all. But perhaps, it's more fun and satisfying for Him to be listened to and have a willing human as a medium for His creativity than having to create everything He wants on His own.
