This is a document for Yosep Ryan Agusta, in hope that he knows who he is and what he holds in the highest regard in his life, so that he is no longer lost his sense of self nor is he lost in life as to how he should live.

I saw a man in my eyesight. He just stood there in the midst of the busyness of life caused by many others around him. In an ever so quick life where everyone rushes to their destinations, he stood there serenely as if he moves gently with time. He isn't in any rush, nor is he taking anything too slowly. Every second that he spent is a second deservedly spent. He doesn't try to make a second half quicker, nor does he make it half slower either. A second is just a second. In his time, he breathes a full breath, then he walks again.

He is a quiet and soft spoken man. He is at peace in his solitude, not actively seeking to be social, or is he against and reserve himself to others. He is capable of living a lone life, not because he refuses companionship or he refuses to rely on others. But primarily, he is a man who can rely on himself. Whenever he encounters a problem, he sees it as a challenge and feel no fear or insufficiency in facing it. However, he is also not shy to ask for help whenever he needs it.

He is a man of God. He fears the Lord and he kneels before Him. He may not shown his Christianity through the loudest of actions, but when the occasion arrives and something moves his heart, then he will move according to the Lord's will.

He is not the kindest of man, in a sense that he makes it his mission to help everyone in need and he is willing to solve the "world's hunger" problem so that the world (and himself) know how kindhearted he is. No, he is not that kind of person. He understands very well his limitations and he accepted it. However, this is not an excuse for him to not go a long way to help someone in need, but rather he understands that he *absolutely* cannot help everyone. 

It's the small acts of kindness in which he is capable of. When he sees a starving person, he would invite them to eat. When he sees a person who needs a lift, he would offer them a lift. He may not be a man driven by a desire to change the world, but he doesn't have as cold of a heart as his demeanor portrays him to be.

For his daily life, he is a man who sees creativity as inevitability. He dedicates his life for his craft and he shares his creations to whoever may find a need for it. He strives to continue on honing his skills. He would study, practice, and be creative until the end of his life. He does it not to achieve any sort of height in his life. But again, he sees it all as an inevitability. His motivation to be creative isn't based on some grandeur missions, but solely because it is what he does. Although he doesn't create for the sake of helping anyone around him, but if someone finds his creation to be of use or even make their life easier, then he sees it as a good thing regardless and he praises the Lord for He enables him to do so. Again, creativity is an inevitability for him. He doesn't question why he creates or the meaning of his creations. He creates simply because it is who he is, and it is what he does.

When I look at him again, he is not a man who have much in his name. He doesn't have a mountain of riches in which he can boast of. It is because he isn't attracted by world riches, be it money, fame, or anything that this world values above anything else. Aside from that, and perhaps more importantly, he understands what is *enough,* and in what God has provided for him lies the abundance of His blessings. He may not have most of what other people chase in this life, but he certainly has more than enough in order for him to live a proper and noble life.

He is indeed a simple man. He may not speak much through his tongue or his body, but he has as much of a desire of life soaring to the sky as those who expresses it loudly. And today too, after he finishes his work for the day, eats his dinner, and prepare to go to bed, he praises God for the day he has been blessed with. He wishes for protection whilst he is asleep, and a wish for the Lord to wake him up the next day. For tomorrow, he will continue on living his quiet and noble life filled to the brim with his creative works.
