The stillness, the laziness, the hesitation, and the uncertainties of life boils down to its absurdity and futility. I'm still in the state of what I call "stopping before the wall." It's a wall that stands between what I need to do and myself. However, I don't blame the wall; for if I want to, I can just push it and it shall fall. But it is clear to the eye that I'm not willing to do it, because I see no point in going beyond this wall, at least for now.

I've returned to this hole where I ponder about how futile everything is. I have projects that I want to build and new things that I want to learn. But the uncertainties of whether any of my doing could be of any use in the future keeps me at bay. I don't know if I will go somewhere if I finish this project. Or I don't know if I can make use of what I've been studying at this moment. The sheer futility of things continues to haunt me, and sadly, I heed to its voice.

When I was thinking about the futility of life, I was reminded by Sisyphus in Greek mythology. I roughly recall that he was a man who got punished by Hades for cheating death twice by making Sisyphus push giant rock to the top of the mountain just for it to roll back down before it reaches its peak, and Hades makes him do it for eternity. Imagine doing such labor while knowing that the rock is to roll back down the mountain, and for us to only repeat it for eternity to come. I bet none of us would think that we could endure such task. However, Camus had a different perspective about Sisyphus and his labor.

Albert Camus was a philosopher who is well-know for his view of the absurdity of life. I haven't read any of his book, but I do read a few bits from articles that were written by those who have. I probably won't be able to elaborate more about the absurdity of life that Camus stated. However, I do wonder if what I'm feeling right now is the absurdity itself.

In regards to Sisyphus, Camus argued that despite the absurdity of Sisyphus' punishment, Camus can find meaning and fulfillment through his rebellion against the absurdity of the task. Basically saying, even if it is absurd, it is okay.

In the face of futility and absurdity of life, rather than grimacing over how futile it is, we are also invited to welcome it as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. It is an invitation to a journey with its highs and lows, without promise of any finish line in sight.

In my personal case, to what I call "the wall," I can push it down whenever I can. If I choose to push it, then that means I have accepted the invitation to welcome the sheer amount of possibilities and embark on a journey. 

Right now, I haven't truly push the wall down. I would take a peek over the top and take one step forward, but I've never committed myself to take a stride and keep on walking. Perhaps, it is time for me to accept the fact that I would never find a finish line or the end of the tunnel, and embrace the journey instead. If I choose to work on that one project, then I wouldn't do it with a frame of mind that I would get something out of it, but rather it's because I simply want to build it. The same for when I want to learn new things, I shouldn't expect that I can turn it into something useful, but because I want to satisfy my curiosity and desire to master them.

And the same, I guess, could be said when it comes to becoming a member of society, whether it be getting a job or involved in any noble cause. It is perhaps unwise of me to burden myself with the thoughts and possibilities of having any sort of responsibility. But rather, I want to join the community because I want to discover the world and find a place where I can be of service. This must not be a burden as in I need to be perfect, never fail, and make everyone happy. But rather a simple desire and willingness to hold my share of weight of society. So that with however much service I can offer, I would be able to lighten other people's burden and help them push through the difficulties of life.

In a general sense of everything, deep down in my heart, I believe that life is not meaningless. Though I often see many things as futile, but ultimately, I have the ultimate hope that is in Jesus Christ. Although it is hard for me to see the meaning of life by becoming His follower, and although I can sometimes hear His voice, if I can't have faith in myself, then none of the task that is assigned to me will get done. 

To be able to embrace the uncertainties of life, to get a hold of myself to keep myself strong, and to believe in myself more are the first steps for me to become a better disciple. Until I can do any of that, I don't think I will ever be a useful and faithful disciple of Christ, and a good servant to the community.
