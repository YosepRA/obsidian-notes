Life is indeed full of uncertainties. When we think we can hold on to something, the next time we know it, they disappear to thin air. We can rely on someone today, tomorrow they may abandon us for their own interest. What we learn rigorously today may become obsolete in the future. None is certain apart from God, and that is okay.

When I reflect on my current state of life where I can't be certain of anything in this world. The world is so full of malice that I don't know whether God will strike this world today or tomorrow. My study is moving too slowly to my liking that it leaves me with great doubt as to whether I could make any use of it in my lifetime. 

The image of the Dunning-Kruger appears in my mind. Today, I feel like I'm still stuck in the valley. I've known from a long ago how much of things that I don't know. It's so much that I feel like I'm staring at the Mt. Everest from close distance. However, the height of Everest don't daunt me. It doesn't daunt me not in a sense that I'm arrogant enough to reach its peak, but rather a sense of acceptance to the fact that this is the amount of knowledge in this world, and it is very likely that my whole lifetime isn't enough for me to even hike enough distance of it.

I know that I will never know anything. I know that I will truly never master anything in life, even if I dedicate my whole life to it. But again, that is okay, because that is the point of it all. This revelation doesn't pose me with a sense of despair, but rather of hope and excitement. Because now I know that no matter how far I go, there will always be something new to learn. No matter how much knowledgeable I am today, tomorrow I may come to a slightly different solution. In this ever changing lump of knowledge, the faith in myself shall only lies in my abilities to learn new things and adapt. And this shall be the main theme of my life, a life that many other have realized and chosen to take, a life where we become a *lifelong learner*.

The main cause for all of my struggles this year is my fear and doubt as to how I can use what I learn today. Say I want to learn more about low-level programming today, what will I use this knowledge later? I must say, I don't know. I don't know... I couldn't imagine myself becoming a computer geek that is so enthusiastic that I will make a breakthrough in the tech landscape. 

However... This path that I've chosen, the path where I learn computer science and engineering by myself. My words may sound dreamy, but I feel at peace if I choose to dedicate myself on this path. 

This is not the path that many people choose. Unlike the shortcut where people do everything in a hurry, this path is slow and winding. This is a long and arduous path where it requires a sheer amount of patience and persistence that I couldn't fathom as a somewhat lazy person. However, even if it's long, even if it's difficult, I feel like I'm called to walk this path. This is a feeling like when we are praying to God and ask Him whether we can choose a certain path, and He says okay and gives His blessings. If I walk this long path, I feel at peace as if I know that I'm walking according to His will. This paragraph right here just summarize my faith in my life principles.

See, even if I feel at peace about walking this path, I still don't know where this path is headed to. Although yes, this uncertainties have caused me many distress that I caused myself and prevents me from doing the necessary works. But in the end, whenever I try to reconsider this path, I always come to the same exact conclusion. That it is okay for me to walk this path, and dedicate all of my life in patience and persistence to walk it through. I may not know where this path is headed, but I know that God will use it in some way later down the road.

This goes the same with many other yet similarly difficult path that I can choose. One of them is to become good at drawing art and writing stories. Even this habit of mine to write out my thoughts in a form of notes is part of my journey to become a writer later.

Again, I don't know exactly where I'm going. All I have is this path in front of me, a path which I've chosen, a path which I've acknowledge to be difficult, and my faith to God. All I need to do is to walk it out, with sheer patience and persistence, and with eyes solely focused on Jesus. Day by day, I continue to learn what it truly means *to leave everything in God's hands.*

I pray for you in all of your journey. Thank you and God bless you all.
