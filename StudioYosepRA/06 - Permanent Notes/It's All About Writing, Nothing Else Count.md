An act of studying is an act of writing. We cannot separate between these two. You can't study by simply reading a book or listening to a lecture. If you wish for these information to stick in your head, you would have the desire to write it all down. And an act of writing your thoughts is studying in its essence itself.

Therefore, since writing is studying, does that mean that we have to put more time to write instead of reading a book or listening to lectures in a sense that we should neglect the latter two for writing a better note? Certainly not. 

Writing is certainly a time consuming activity. Although it's definitely worth your time to spend it to write. But then it becomes problematic, especially in a habit of note-taking, that writing takes *way too much time,* such as writing a note with 1000+ words every time you find an interesting idea. Way too much time spend on a note that should've been written briefly. Writing this much can indeed become problematic when you choose to write your "essay" rather than taking brief notes. There are times for us to expand those notes further. But oftentimes, notes should be brief.

The point is, sure, writing is worth it and we should spend more effort in making it a habit. But that doesn't mean that we should be less better at reading or listening to lectures. It means that we those things *differently.* Since our purpose to read and listen to lectures to study, therefore writing, we will inevitably pay more attention to the material that we are consuming. We would stop and think more about the sentences that we just read, and we would do the same to what our lecturers are explaining to us. Because our intention is for us to write them down, therefore think more about it, be it right now or later.

This way, we would approach our material with much more *deliberate intent* to study, to write them down, rather than just treating it like our assignment to read an X amount of books, or spend the time in the lecture hall just because you don't want to be seen as a slacker for missing classes.

By doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do *deliberately.* Since deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing.

To conclude it all, therefore, write! Write more about your thoughts and ideas. Keep it brief and concise without sacrificing its quality. As you write more, it will change how you approach your study materials. You will then grow to respect your study process, because you deliberately think about what you are reading and listening.
