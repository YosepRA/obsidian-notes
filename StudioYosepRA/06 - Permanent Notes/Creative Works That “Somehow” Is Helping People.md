Why do people get creative? For what purpose do they spend all of their efforts to produce a creative work? What do they see at the end of the line that motivate them to start and continue on working?

These are the questions that I often ask myself in my doubts and anxieties.

I love being creative. I love the feeling of getting my hands dirty by building stuff from ground up. I feel satisfied whenever I build stuff from scratch, then once I finish it, I relish on the realization that *I have indeed built this.* They may not be the best in the world that will make people astonished by it. But I created these works. I'm proud of it because I made it, but moreover, I'm grateful because I pushed through the difficulties along the way. I indeed love being a creative individual.

However... As I grow older, so is my responsibilities. One of such responsibilities is, of course, to make a living. Not only for myself, but also for my loved ones. I don't hate having such responsibilities as if treating it as a burden. But when I can't fulfill said responsibilities, what I feel is an immense guilt.

At one point in my life, I thought about the idea that I *must* use my creativity to make a living, or to be more crudely put, *to make money.* Somehow, someway, I need to use what I supposedly enjoy doing and sell it to other people so that I can put food on the table.

The last sentence, as I write it, it triggers a massive vortex within my heart about this issue in particular. So much I want to say about it as many different factions within me were arguing their cases on this topic. I don't know if I'm capable of surmising what different parts of myself is arguing, but I can at least conclude it into one sentence that all of myself can agree;

**"Whenever I try to start building stuff, then I ask myself 'How can I make money out of it later on?' Then after that, my creative desire would shrink into oblivion, down to the pits of the abyss where I can't see it any longer."**

The desire to be creative, the desire to make money, and the desire to stay alive. These three continue to clash within me, leaving me with no rest. Whenever I think of being creative, then I ask about money. Once I become pessimistic about money, then I worry about putting food on the table and staying alive. Then those worries spread on even further on the wellbeing of my mother and all whom I care about. 

I feel crippled. I can't move. I know what I need to do, which is to work and use my creative power and desire anyway. But sadly, the negative voices are too loud for me to ignore. While it's true that those thoughts don't define my reality, but it doesn't mean that those thoughts don't hold bits of truth in it.

Before I realize it, I have carried the burden that failure in my creative works means death, not only to me, but also my family. I don't need to say this, but this is not a healthy mindset to have. And as I write this, I'm trying to dig deeper into this feelings.
