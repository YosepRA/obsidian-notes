Kompany on people who said Bayern job was bigger than him: “I'll tell you something in a quick way just to prove a point”. 

“I was born in Brussels, my dad was a refugee who came from Congo”. 

“What are my chances of even playing in the Premier League, winning something as a player, playing for the national team? The odds were 0.000 something. Now I'm a coach”. 

“Do you just stop believing in yourself and what you can achieve because of what other people say?”. 

“The mentality is to keep going and in the end if you fail you fail, if you succeed you succeed. but you can always become better”. 

“Online you can always find stuff so I really don't take it personal”, says

Fear of failure has been a blight, if not the biggest blight in my life. Whatever I choose or desire to do, a dreadful question will always pop up in my head, "What makes you so sure that you will succeed in any way by doing this? What a laughable man." What comes out of my head is always derisions. It was as if I am my own worst enemy.

Some other time, I would question the meaning in all I do. Why should I do any of these? Is there any meaning in whatever foolish thing you are trying to do? How will you use whatever you want to learn today? If I answer those questions with "I don't know," then the fire would certainly blow off and I wouldn't think about it the second time.

Fear of failure is dreadful. What will I do if I spend 2-3 years doing something, and yet I couldn't do anything with it? Would that be the most wasteful time and life spent ever? I know for certain that the time spent can never return to me. So somehow, someway, I need to make every second count. Meaning, I must *not* fail in all I do in life. Lest everything will be wasted.

It might sound like an ambitious, run-of-the-mill perfectionist mindset. Some people, including me, thought that there is great success at the end of the road if I follow this mindset faithfully. However... For the longest time in my life, I try to "give up" on this perfectionist mindset. Which apparently is something that I've failed to do since its inception as I continue to not make mistake, and fear any sort of failure, or the possibility of failures that may happen in all I try to do.

My constant fear of failure lead me to a perpetual apathy. The question is no longer "What if I fail?" but rather "I'm going to fail anyway. So why bother trying?" Before I know it, failure has become certain in my life, even before I put in the effort to try it first. Everything seems futile to the eye and heart, that any courageous step or thinking couldn't pull me out of this state of unbothered. My heart becomes deadened as I continue to shot down any ideas, or even bother to entertain the act of thinking. My life becomes boring, and I thought that I couldn't do anything with it.

That was the preface of my current state of mind in regards to my fear of action because of fear of failure. I don't think I need to elaborate further on it to explain how much of a deathly cycle it is (and also perhaps, I have written about it many times before in my other notes).

I read about anhedonia. It is a symptom where one is unable to feel pleasure. If someone lacks an ability to feel pleasure, then it is unlikely for them to get excited about something, and be motivated to do something.  Thus, it leads to a state of apathy of action, asking similar questions as I do.

I recognized some of the symptoms of anhedonia, especially the feeling of apathy in everything I do or want to do. I seem to be unable to get excited with whatever the world can offer me. Whenever I'm thinking of doing something, I can't seem to envision any prospect of prosperity from it. For example, I know there is a road so that I can become a master at software engineering and computer science (or at least become quite good at it). But I can't, for the sake of my life, envision what comes next. What will I use those knowledge for? Sure, I want to build useful software to make life a bit easier for other people and myself. But, I don't know precisely how I can achieve it. For the best part of it, there is a possibility of myself "wasting" 5 years of dedicated study of computer science because I couldn't make something useful from it. And this is a dreadful possibility to have.

I put the word "wasting" in double quote because I fully understand that it is not true. No knowledge will become useless. Even if I couldn't imagine of any way to apply those knowledge to provide useful application on real life problem right now, perhaps sometime in the future, I may be able to find one. Therefore, whatever years I put into dedicating myself to study computer science (or any field of knowledge) is kind of like preparing weapons that I may need later down the road. 

Other than that, all knowledge is not one dimensional, meaning that I can only apply what I learn in computer science only in this particular field alone. All knowledge is interconnected with each other. Constantly developing new ideas out of current ones.

Therefore, it is a simple fact that no knowledge that is learned out of goodwill could be wasted in any way. That is why, no matter how many years I could spend on learning anything I care about shall be wasted for any possible grim future there is.

With that being said, I have *no excuse* to not do anything right now because I fear the possibility of wasting my time I spend right now because of any future prospects. If I choose to do it and commit myself to anything right now, it *will* come to be useful later down the road. That much is certain.

One excuse downed, let's go back to anhedonia. Again, it's an inability to feel pleasure. It is true that because of my fear of possibility of wasting my time because of uncertain future, I couldn't get excited or even care to do anything right now. But it isn't true that I am completely incapable of feeling excitement from what I do in life. Sure, I would feel apathy whenever I'm sitting still and not do anything. But I found out time and again, whenever I *chose* to start doing something, and by the time I finished doing the things that I choose to do, I realize that I always feel excited and fulfilled because of the work that I've just done. It was that fulfilled feeling knowing that I've spent my time today doing something I cared about. It was that fulfilled feeling that brought me to a peaceful and grateful sleep at night every day.

It's not that I'm completely unable to feel excited. But as long as I choose to start doing something that I care about, I *will* get excited from doing it.

Therefore, this is not a question of inability to be hopeful of a bright future, nor is it an inability to feel excitement of this life as a whole, but rather it's a matter of choice, of starting or not starting. It is an idea of life that *results do NOT matter at all.* What matters is whether I do it or not. If I fail, I fail. If I succeed, I succeed. The indifference to result is MY key to have a breakthrough. Hence why, what I need to is to, simply, START. I have roadmaps, I have a series of plans to learn new things and build some projects. Commit to do it every day, and don't think of any and all outcomes that may come from your choice. Because you know, and God knows, that I yearn to do these things out of goodwill. And no good seeds shall become a bad tree and reap bad fruits.

Even today, I still learn what it means to leave everything in God's hands. What I wish to do in life is good, and my Lord knows and have blessed me to walk the path. All I need to do is to keep on walking, to never stop, to never think of any results, and to put faith on Him.
