There is nothing new under the sun. Originality is just a pretense of unawareness that it has been done before. No one starts from scratch, ever.

It's scary to face the "blank page", a well-known problem for all creative people. Knowing that you have to start working, but putting an ink on that blank page can serve as a reminder that once you do that, you won't be able to return. It's either you come up with something new, something that has never been done before, or just don't bother trying.

Originality is as much as a sin as plagiarism. Only if it serves as the sole assessment to prove one's creative works. That claiming one's work has never been done before is arrogance. The more appropriate thing to say about works that appear to be fresh is that the creator has found a *new connection* for things that has been done before. This is the true form of originality, as far as our human capabilities can offer. It's humility to not claim one's work as something totally new.

With that in mind, how can we approach our work if nothing is truly new and original? Well, simply don't be bound by the idea itself, the pressure that we have to create something original to prove our worth as a creative person. Sure, it's admirable to always seek the fresh outlook on how to build a new project. But if our motivation is to create something new that will make us popular, then it's better to drop it at that. Again, it will be our arrogance speaking had we listen to that thought.

No one starts from scratch, this is a reality that we must acknowledge, and be encouraged for. We should look at what we've built before, or what others have built before. Be inspired by it, and moreover *steal* it. It's not plagiarism as long as we put enough thoughts on how to make a better revision of the works which we decided to steal. Once we realized that we don't need to put a pressure to make something original *and* choose to steal from our past works and other people's work, then creative work will be an endeavor to not produce originality, but to be as creative as we can instead.
