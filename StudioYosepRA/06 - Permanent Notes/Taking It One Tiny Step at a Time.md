You often hear the phrase "take it one step at a time" when you face an intimidating tasks. The tasks that are too daunting for you and your meager skill to challenge. The idea is to prevent us from running away, mainly because of our fear, or it may also be masked as laziness. And this one of the thing that I've been struggling with for a long while now.

Why is it scary to face a big task? It's mostly because it is seemingly not aligned with what we believe what we can do at the moment. There is no way I can build your company's website because all I have built is only blog sites. Although this is sometimes the case, but we would often find that we can do the difficult tasks regardless of our perceived experience.

Oftentimes, what we truly need is a little bit of a nudge to our back and courage to take the first step. After that, we can let our steps carry ourselves to the next ones until we find a good place to stop (when we finish the task). That is simply it.

But then, how can we find the courage to take the first step? Because the task is never going to get less scary that it is. *We reduce the size of our tasks into its tiniest form possible.*

Say, I'm working on redesigning my personal website. I want to improve its interactivity on my project list so that it stands out more. Aside from that, I would also like to add a blogging system for me to write daily on. It's a big task, for sure. It's even bigger for someone who has been idle and haven't touched code consistently enough in about six months now. My skills are rusty, and not to mention my general rock-bottom confidence when it comes to designing UIs.

It is a bother to drag myself everyday on this project. Sometimes, I would read books instead of working on the project. Sometimes, I would work a tiny bit on the project and settle with it. I'm basically stuck in this cycle of not working hard enough, and easing my guilt by "studying" (reading books or watching tutorials) instead. In the end, the project remain untouched. A project which shouldn't take longer than two weeks at most to finish.

In the face of such daunting task, how can I push myself to start grinding? Again, I must reduce the task to its tiniest form possible. I feel scared of designing the UI? It's okay, try to work on the wireframe first. Is it still scary to do the wireframes? It's okay, let's write the website structure first. Okay, I see that writing the website structure doable. Now, I've finished planning the structure, what's next? Ah, wireframe, is it? It's still too big for me. Okay, let's focus on the home page first and draw plain texts and boxes, and focus on the layout and positioning instead of the beauty. Ah, I think it's possible for me to focus on the layout first, so let's do that.

The process goes on and on as I continue to scrutinize on the details and reduce the size of the tasks as much as possible until I found a sizeable chunk which I can work on. It doesn't matter how small it is. For all I concerned, I could reduce it to "drawing a single box" if it means that I could push myself to work.

Therefore, it's not about taking it one step at a time, but rather *taking it one* tiny *step at a time.* It is not small, not little, but tiny. It's a speck of sand that leads to yet another speck to work on, and finally, it shall be a mountain.
