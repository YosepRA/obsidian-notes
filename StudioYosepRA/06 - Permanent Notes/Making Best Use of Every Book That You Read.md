Whenever we start reading a book, it's easy for us to expect that the book will have information that we seek. However, there is no guarantee that to be true. Perhaps the book's content only have a bit of information that you need, and the rest are unrelated to you. Truly, this is a bit of a shame because we spend time and effort to read the book. And if it ends up with unnecessary information, it's easy to feel that we have wasted our time.

That's why it's better to make best use of every book that we read by taking notes and follow the trail of ideas that surface itself as we read it.

True, the content itself may not be as useful as we initially thought when we started reading it. But it's also true that there are sparks of idea that show itself when we read it. Writing notes can help us with recording these wild ideas, putting it on paper (well, in my case a Markdown file), and preserve it for future reading and expansion of it.

Time is expensive after all. Especially for people who appreciate the endeavor of life-long study. It's the habit of note-writing, the habit of *thinking* through your writing that makes these seemingly useless knowledge stick to our brain. For it's more likely for us to remember information which we wrote and think thoroughly.

If that were the case, then no knowledge is ever useless. We just haven't found a way to apply it in our life. Therefore, it's so much better to record our reading than complain about how useless the book is in the book's review page.
