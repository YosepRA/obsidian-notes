Why are we here, just to suffer? We often hear quotes similar to this which emphasize the suffering in life. It appears that suffering sticks way easier to our head than our joys. That no matter how much happiness we get in one moment, somehow we know that it won't last and our next round of sorrow is just waiting down in the corner. Even worse to that pessimistic view of life, people would even rationalize their happiness as a preparation of the sufferings ahead, then it leads to an undeserving feeling of happiness, and ultimately, it leads to what is called *The Fear of Happiness* or *Happiness Anxiety.* It's like when they are feeling happy, people would ask "Oh no, I'm happy. I'm about to suffer after this. What should I do?" Indeed. To most of us, suffering is all there is in this world. And I'm also guilty of that view of life.

Life is chock-full of suffering. We all know that and there is no point in arguing about it. However, the amount of happiness and joy isn't all that little either. When we ask people whether they want to be happy or suffer, surely they would want to be happy, wouldn't they? Then when you ask them to describe what is happiness, every one of them would give different answers. One would describe the life of abundance, be it money and assets. Yet some other would answer a life full of loving families and friends. But I think most of us would agree that true happiness can only come when we go to Heaven.

How would you describe Heaven? Is it a place free of suffering? Is it a place where we no longer have to fight for our survival? Is it a place where no one gets hurt? I wonder how would people describe Heaven, if they believe there is one, of course. 

A place free of suffering, huh? Doesn't it sound good? We no longer have to be afraid of people taking things away from us. We no longer have to take something from others in order to survive as well. In said eternity, we shall find ourselves not needing to do all of the things that causes suffering in this world. Would you want to go to such a place? Heck, would you want such a place to be applied to our current world right here, right now? It's a world where we don't have to bear the responsibility of survival after all. A world where *we don't have to make a choice.*

Life is all about the choices we make. Whether you want to wear a shirt, or jacket. Eat bananas or pizza for breakfast. Stay in our current job, or find a new one. Forgive the murderer of your family, or drown ourselves in eternal hatred or even take your hands on revenge. 

It's all about the choices we make, and whatever your decision, it will lead you to somewhere in life. One of your choice would lead you to a happy place, in cost of others' sorrow. At yet another time, your choice will lead you to a bad place, and it causes the happiness of someone you hate. Each and everyone makes their own choice. Together, it forms the tapestry of life. Ever so connected, enjoyed, and detested.





I got these stories from a game called *Honkai Star Rail.* It's a story of a sibling, an older brother Sunday and a younger sister Robin. In that story, they found a dying fledgling that just fell from its nest up above the tree. It got hurt from the fall and appear to unable to fly for some time. In their kindness, they ponder whether they can take care of it until it recovers or just let it go and live its life in the wild. After some time, they decided to take care of the little fledgling. 

They gave it the best food there is, nurtured its wounds, and even took care of its feathers. Until one day, the sister has to leave home and they decide to finally let the fledgling go back and fly. As the sister has to leave already, she can't witness how the fledgling fly. That leaving the brother alone waiting for the bird as it tried to fly off his window. He waited, waited, and waited... After a hundred and thirty seventh time of asking, the bird finally able to take off the window and fly. The brother's heart is filled with joy and he couldn't wait to write a letter to his sister to tell her about it. 

But alas, the fledgling isn't used to wind's current hitting its wings. The bird was losing its balance and it couldn't control its falling body. In the end, the bird falls down and hit the ground below. The boy rushes downward to see the bird, and he found the ripped wings of the bird which he and his sister took great care of. In his hands is the dying bird. Compared to the last time however, there is nothing he could do to safe it as the bird drew its last breath. It was as if their choice to take care of the bird back then was no different than letting the bird live in the wild. Nay, even worse, it was like their choice to take care of it results in the bird's despairing fall and death. It was as if their choice doesn't make any difference at all as it results in suffering.

One other story about the brother. He grew up to be a servant of his God, God of Harmony. A God whose faith is the virtue of the strong defending the weak, that everyone lives in blissful harmony. The boy grew up and become what is similar to priests in his family. One of his job is to listen to people's confession and giving them penance for God's forgiveness.

He listened to many people's confession. Some of them were sincere, some of them were arrogant, yet some other were just filth of unrepentance. Once he listened to a confession of an adult man. He and his family were poor. And he heard that in Penacony, the boy's hometown, there is an opportunity to strike it rich. 

The man then sold everything, *literally everything,* in order to arrive in this city. He sold his house, land, and his two children to slavery. But not too long after arriving in Penacony, the man was chased by the police for being a stowaway. Then he ran to Sunday, who is of an important family in Penacony, to sought forgiveness. He sought forgiveness because he sold his children. He thought at least by selling them as slaves, his children would have something to eat. And he vowed to be rich in Penacony in order to buy his children back. Touched by it, Sunday then chooses to help the man by ordering the police to stop pursuing him.

Long story short, the man indeed make it rich in Penacony as he became one of the tycoons in the city. His riches would strike an awe to all of the dream chasers and he had more money than he needs. One day, the man got arrested for plotting a coup to one of the most influential family in Penacony. Sunday aware of the man came to his hearing. He then asked the man of why would he do such a thing after he finally makes it in Penacony. And then, Sunday continued to ask the man about his children. To Sunday's shock, the man answered "What children?"

Should Sunday helped the man back when he was chased by the police? It was as if his act of forgiveness and kindness results in the abandonment of the children whose survival is unknown to him in the end. It was as if his choice doesn't make any difference at all as it results in suffering.

One last story about the sibling. Robin grew up to be a fine woman and a diva of the galaxy. Her voice could bring ease and happiness to those who were listening. And her kindness and faithfulness to the God of Harmony makes her even more loved by the people.

One time, Sunday receives a letter from his sister delivered by his grandfather. The letter contains the usual reports of Robin's tour in one of the planets. It appears to be a normal report from his sister as he quickly wraps up the letter. The grandfather, however, asked Sunday whether he knows where Robin is going. Sunday of course knew where his sister went and mentioned the planet's name. Then the grandfather further asked Sunday whether Robin wrote anything about "stray bullet" in her letter.

Sunday understandably shook of the news. What stray bullet, he asked. The grandfather realized that the brother isn't aware that the planet which Robin went to is currently in the middle of a war. Unaware to Sunday, Robin went there not to perform in a tour, but rather to the frontline to support the allied force defending the planet. She does this out of her benevolence and faithfulness to her God, Harmony.

Unfortunately however, as Robin helped in the frontline, she got shot by a stray bullet to her neck, leaving her in a state of crisis and in need of operations. Fortunately enough as everyone believe, she was given mercy because of her faithfulness to Harmony that the bullet didn't hit the vital veins in her neck, and therefore the operations were able to save her life.

It was out of pure kindness and faithfulness to her God, Harmony, did Robin go to the frontline. But in return to that benevolent act, she got hit by a stray bullet to her neck. It was as if her kindness lead to suffering for both her and her brother. It was as if her choice doesn't make any difference at all as it results in suffering.





Life is indeed all about the choices we make. And we reap what we sow. If we do good deeds, the good deeds will return to us. Likewise, if we do evil, then evil is nothing but an inevitability later on. These are the truth of life, and I think there is nothing that can overturn it other than God himself.

But then, what about the stories above? It was as if their choice results in sorrow and suffering. This one is also true. And I believe many of us have encountered this in our life beyond the stories above. It's true that one reap what one sow. But it's also true that bad things can also happen because of our good deeds. This is as much reality as suffering is.

Now, I have a question. You have a choice in front of you. You can choose to do good deed, bad deed, or be indifferent. Now you know that whatever your choice is, it may lead to the suffering of you, your loved ones, or other people somewhere. If you know the seemingly inevitable outcome of suffering in whatever you choose, would you still choose to do good deeds? Or perhaps you would rather choose to do bad deeds because it doesn't matter anyway? Or would you choose to be indifferent? What would you choose?

Is the inevitability of suffering an excuse for us to not be a good person? If forgiving the murderer of your family means that said murderer to kill yet another family, would you be able to forgive yourself for forgiving the murderer? Would you be able to forgive yourself for doing what is good, which is being merciful to others? 

**If having a freedom to make a choice itself is the root of all sufferings, would you still rather have this freedom?**





In the illustration of Heaven that many people have, a place free of suffering. In such a place, that also means that we no longer have to make anymore choice in our life. We can just live blissfully because when we don't have to make a choice, there won't be any suffering.

Would you forgo your freedom of choice for such a blissful life? Would you choose to no longer bear the responsibility of your choice? Would you live a life devoid of any desire because you no longer have the power to choose your own destiny? Would you rather have such a life?

For me personally, I'm intrigued by the idea of such Heaven. Because think about it. Life is full of suffering, so why not make it happy instead? Isn't that what we all want? Haha, that is true. But at the same time, I too understand how boring it would be. 

Life without choice is a life without desire. Life without desire is a life without a drive for anything at all. All of us would just sit around and stare at the sun and talk about nothing at all. Why? Because we no longer desire for anything anymore anyway. Without desire, there is no curiosity. Without curiosity, there is no question. Without question, there is no conversation to have or something to share. It's even duller than watching the paint dry, I say.

Then a controversial question pops up in my mind. **Is suffering really all that bad?** I mean, yes, suffering is bad. I won't wish it on anybody. I don't want to suffer as much as the next person. But at the same time, I also understand that the reason why I can stand up right now is because I once fell to the ground and suffer because of it. I chose to stand up and walk because I have the power and the right to choose.

I realize how suffering builds people up. How suffering teaches people how to stand back up. If life is chock-full of happiness and only happiness, how would we know how it feels to fall to the ground, to lose our job, lose our loved ones, or lose our reason to live? How would we find direction before we suffer from being lost in life? How could we feel happy if we don't know how it is to feel sad? 

Without suffering, we won't understand what happiness is. Without happiness, we won't know the reason for our suffering. It's two sides of the same coin as suffering is as much as a virtue as happiness.

Yes... After all, I'm not willing to give up my right to choose what is good. It's true that life is full of suffering. And it's true that my choice could lead to the suffering for me and the others. But despite that, I also believe that there is as much happiness as there is suffering in this world. And finally, good deeds will ultimately results in good things also. We just don't know when exactly.

Hence why, I would choose to be a good person. For I don't wish for a life filled only with suffering, nor do I wish a life filled only with happiness. For sufferings teach me how to stand back up and live, and happiness teach me to be thankful of my past sufferings. I'm grateful for I have a choice in my life.
