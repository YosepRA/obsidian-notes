Today is not as fruitful as the past few days. I spent my morning in absolute laziness, and I didn't do anything in terms of grinding. So, this is one of those days where there isn't much to write about.

Despite my wasteful morning, I still managed to do my 5 laps jog this afternoon. I thought I wouldn't be able to push myself to put my shoes on. But I ended up putting it on and went for a run anyway. My run went a bit better than yesterday. I was less gasping for air and I feel less nauseated in my head. In the end, I pushed for a bit further than 5 laps, and went for half-a-lap more. 

Although my goal for months to come is not about intensity and volume, but rather consistency. I want to challenge myself with the same question everyday, asking whether I would go for a run or laze around in the afternoon. I want to always choose the former from now on.

Some say that the important part of building a good (and difficult) habit is to not break the chain. For some, it serves as a motivation to continue building the chain day after day. However, I see this notion to be a burden instead. If I commit myself to not let my chain break, then if by circumstances (or choice of laziness) we break the chain, there is this guilty feeling that lingers for a long time.

The next time you want to continue your habit, you would doubt yourself because of the futility in continuing an already broken chain. If it's already broken, why should I continue this habit anyway? I know that this is a problem of perfection that some people (including myself) deal with. They can always choose to continue on with their commitment to build up their habits. However for perfectionists, it could feel as if they are starting anew with their habits. And that is not a satisfying feeling to feel as if the bricks of your house that you have meticulously build so far has crumbled, and now they are starting again. As a perfectionist, why bother restarting then?

That's why I'm in a disagreement with this notion of not letting the chain break. On the other hand, I have a thought. It's not about not letting the chain break, *but rather exercising our power to choose.*

It's not news for us all that we are presented with choice all the time in our waking hours. Therefore, taking choice should have been our daily bread since we were born. To be conscious of this power and right for us to exercise our free will to choose can be detrimental in our journey. In the case of having a daily exercise, rather than a question and motivation to not let the chain break, it's a question of whether you are willing to *choose* to exercise or not.

That being said, there will be time when we do not choose to do what we need to do. And of course, I would feel guilty if I choose not to exercise in the afternoon later in the future. However, because I choose to not do it today, I will have the same choices tomorrow for me to pick yet again. At that time, rather than feeling that I need to start over, it's a conviction that a new day and new opportunity deserves another chance for us to pick the right choice.

"A new day is a new life for a wise men."

What happens in the past has passed away. You absolutely can't do anything to change it. What happens in the future is not of your privilege to know. However, we live today, and we always have choices in front of us. Let's start anew everyday, and strive to choose the right thing at every moment.
