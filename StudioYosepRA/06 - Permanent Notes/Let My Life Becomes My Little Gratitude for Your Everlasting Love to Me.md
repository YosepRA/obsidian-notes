Let this writing be a letter for my Father in Heaven, my Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit who is always with me. For despite how flawed and fragile I am today, my Lord has always loved me, even before I was ever born.

I'm grateful for this life. I'm grateful that You have blessed me with life here on earth and be among this vast universe. I'm grateful that you have nurtured me from the day I was born, until now where I'm almost reach 26 years of life. I'm grateful for my parents, primarily my grandmother, mother, and sister who have always been an extended hand for Your love. Thank you for allowing me to live this long and for every opportunities that You have given me to grow as an individual, and as Your son.

I'm sorry that I haven't been a good son to You and my parents. For as long as I remember, I've always been a deadweight for my parents. I couldn't reply their kindness and generosity with enough of my own kindness. That they feel saddened and most likely disappointed with how I am today too. It's all truly my fault, I won't run away from it. I'm sorry, mom. I truly am. I truly wish that you can live a carefree life in your old days. But here I am being a deadweight to your everlasting love to me too. To that, I wish to hold all of the responsibility for my sins for being a useless son to you.

There are times when I feel too guilty to live. But at the same time, I understand that ending it all on my own is not only a cowardly thing to do, but also the greatest sin I would ever commit. I won't dare to face my Lord if I die in such an ungrateful way. However, the guilt of not having been able to reply the Lord's and my parents' kindness continues to weigh me down. Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to bear this burden for I'm truly willing to reply their kindness. But the fact that the guilt continues to bore into my heart and cause great sadness to me every day is not something that I can ignore.

I won't throw some cheesy promises like "I will build a new house for my parents" or "I want to become the beacon of my faith to Christ through my works". No... I've gone past the point of such glamour. My sole wish, and it's probably my greatest and most foundational wish, is I want to live. I want my life to be my little gratitude for those who have been kind to me. Because no amount of what I can give can surpass what my Lord and my parents have given to me. Even if I can live for hundreds of thousands of years, or even the eternal itself, no amount of my gratitude and thanks would ever suffice for my Lord and my parents' kindness.

I don't know what defines "my best." It could be many things according to all sorts of metrics. But in the end, my best is my best. Whatever good I choose to do for today, and whatever I pour my heart over, these are "my best." I... I can only promise you that.

Lord. I don't know how long You will allow me to live. But as long as I am allowed to live, I want to live, and live it to my best of ability. In the end, this is what all of my wishes amount to. It may appear abstract to a plain human eye, but it's as concrete as I can express it to be. 

Let Your will be done in my life. And let my life becomes my little gratitude for Your everlasting love to me.
