My first blog post. Hooray! Although this is not my first ever blog post, because I once wrote and maintained a blog site using free WordPress service. Therefore, this isn't new for me. The language may appear crude or even sometimes outright inappropriate (relative to how finely written posts out there). However, I would still maintain the carefree spirit of writing as I once was back then.

In my first blog site, I wrote basically about daily life, primarily as a developer. I would write about what I've learned on that day, about what I thought about the materials, the frustrating rant for the difficulties which I faced, and of course, the successes when I found a solution to a problem or when I managed to build a simple to-do list app. It was truly about my daily life which I wrote as appropriately as possible. But the most important part of all, it tells who I really am, as a lifelong software engineer and as a creative person.

For StudioYosepRA blog, I will stick to the same idea. I would write about what I've gone through for the day as I do my works, and I would write it in a casual and carefree way where I don't particularly care about writing a thesis quality of a writing, but they are appropriate enough for someone to read on. And of course, the most important motivation for writing these posts is for me to record my journey, so that I could look back and see what I've gone through. Some of them may be useful, yet some other may be about myself ranting about a frustrating problem of the day.

However, I think I've found a catch about writing a daily blog consisting of what I've gone through for the day. And actually, it was the main reason as to why I stopped writing for my 300 plus posts WordPress blog site. It was because I got a job.

When I write about the day, and when I also have a job, it is inevitable for me to write about what I do on my job on that particular day. I may be saying that I would wrote something inappropriate about my work that can get me into trouble. Not at all. Intentionally, I would never write something inappropriate about my work. However, it's easy for me to write something that may be inappropriate to my coworkers. 

Say I face a challenge in my task for the day. I would write about said problem and my thought process in the matter. So far so good, and there is nothing inappropriate to be seen. However, when facing a challenge, it's easy for frustration to seep into the process. I may say that this particular problem is frustrating and requires me to do a lot of research. And I would write it in my blog post for the day. I won't hide from my struggles just because I want to appear perfect. But this can cause problems if my coworkers happen to read this kind of struggle post and judge me as being incapable for the job. It can certainly happen, and this is where the problem lies.

If this is the case, then what should I do? It is certain that I would never write inappropriate posts just because I feel like gossiping or stabbing my coworkers on their backs. I'm not that kind of person as I will say those things in front of their face instead. Then what about the ones that may appear inappropriate to my coworkers when I don't intend to be so? And unlike me, my coworkers may hide it in their hearts and do some nasty bullying in our works together. Again, it is a possibility. 

If so, then what should I do? For one thing, I would love to keep on writing. Because I love writing daily posts as it helps me organize my thoughts and draw conclusion for the day. But at the same time, I don't want to spell unnecessary problem for my coworkers just because of some silly misunderstanding of what I wrote in yesterday's post.

For this, I think I would keep on writing. And if there is a misunderstanding, I would like to straighten it up. God willing that He will guide me and my coworkers so that these misunderstandings can be settled peacefully. After all, I write these daily posts with good intention in heart.

There comes my conclusion. I would write daily posts on this site. I may not have a job at the moment of writing, but if I do in the future, I would keep on writing what happens on that day.

*(P.S. I wrote this post prior to the release of the blogging feature for StudioYosepRA. Therefore, I won't post this until I have it ready and deployed on my website. And I would keep on stacking daily posts until the feature is released.)*
