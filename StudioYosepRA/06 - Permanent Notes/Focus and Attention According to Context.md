"Oshin Vartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them."

"\[…] The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame." (Dean, 2013, 152)

What we think when it comes to focus is the same as when you create a sun's death ray using a magnifying glass. You can see how the sunlight is being focused to a single spot, creating a ray of light that has an extreme heat as it can even burn through rocks. It's similar to when most of us think about giving attention on something, that is we put our eyes and mind on one thing at that one time. This kind of attention is called *focused attention.*

When it comes to focused attention, we need to consciously trigger it, as if telling our brain to get focused on this one book that I'm reading. Triggering this attention requires willpower because when you choose to give more attention to your one particular subject, and at the same time discarding everything else that isn't related to said subject.

That is one kind of attention. Wait, *one kind?* Is there any type of attention other than focused attention? Oh yes, there is. Let me ask you a question.

Have you ever entered a state of deep focus when you are working on something? A state of focus and attention that you forget the flow of time as you are becoming immersed in your work. Only when something snaps you out of that state of trance do you realize that you were just in that state of deep focus.

Although this may seem to be a setup for me to talk about *flow,* a term for a state of deep focus found by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, but I'm here to talk about something else, which is the different kinds of attention and focus on our life according to its context.

Focused attention and flow are quite different. One of them requires you to consciously trigger it, while the other often feels like they come however it wants (although this isn't true at all as there are conditions for the state of flow). When most people are talking about a state of focus, they oftentimes talk about focused attention. But I guess we all can agree that it's so much more enjoyable to enter a state of flow instead.

How long can you redirect your brain's attention and maintain its focus on your desired subject? I guess it can't be that long before your mind starts to wander yet again. For me, it's only short of 10 seconds. I tested it when I try to read an uninteresting book, and I put my focus on analyzing not only what is written in the book, but also the structure and how the author phrase their words. And the answer I get from that experiment is only 10 seconds at most before my mind starts to wonder about the dinner tonight.

On the other hand for flow state, as long as the conditions align with each other, we would naturally enter the state of flow even without us realizing it. But again, as much as I want to be more elaborate about flow as it's one of my most interested topic, I want to talk about something else in this note, which is again the different kinds of attention and focus on our life according to its context.

Let's say you have kids in your house. As a parent, surely you would pay attention to how your kids play and interfere with them when it gets too dangerous. You put close attention to how they use their toy and perhaps how they wrestle each other in the living room. And only when you notice in your attention that your older boy is sitting on your younger one do you stop the older one from doing so.

Now, switch back to when you are working on your creative project in your study room. Again, you put your attention to your medium in front of you. As you play around with your tools to work on your project, you too put an attention to your work.

Between these two states of attention, do you think they are the same kind of attention? When you are watching your kids, you have to keep tuned in on how your kids play. On the other hand when you are working on your creative project, you are rarely bound by a certain set of rules that you have to stroke your brush this way, or build that part a certain other way. The former requires you to continually spend your willpower to maintain your focus, but your creative project requires you to basically play around and let your attention *floats* around your head.

Many of us think that in order to become high-achievers, we need to know how to trigger our focused attention on demand. That is whenever we need it, we can just snap our finger and put ourselves in what we think as deep focus. However, that is hardly the truth.

Different tasks requires different set of tools. On one task, you may need to be more intentionally focused on your work, such as when you are watching your kids play, or when you are performing surgery. But there are other works that requires you to let your attention floats around, such as when you are experimenting on your project.

In an ideal world, however, we would often consciously trigger our focus switch and go on with our work. And if the conditions for flow were fulfilled, we would continue on and enter the flow state anyway.

Therefore, it's important for us to be flexible in how we pay attention to our tasks at hand. Do know there are tasks suitable for focused attention, and there are others suitable for floating attention. To understand and put them into practice can help you elevate yourself in your life and study. Well, just now, I realized that I've just used my floating attention as I let words form up in my mind and write it in this note.
