There is something that I must say, but cannot. Therefore, I will write it instead. Lest, this bottled up emotions would blow up into something really ugly, and something I wish I won't do. I'm writing this in hope so that I can gain clarity and resolution to the conflict at hand. So that I can put all of my focus and energy solely on my own life.

I have a bike. I had it since I got my first job. I paid about 30% of the installments, and my family helped me to pay the rest because I lost my job in the middle of the installment period. To that, I'm forever grateful. And to that, I perfectly understand that the bike isn't necessarily mine at all.

Fast forward to today. There has been an oil leakage at some part at the front of the bike, I assume it's from the front shock. I've noticed this leakage for about half-a-year ago. And unfortunately, I haven't had the fortune to fix it yet.

Today, my grandmother asked me to bring it to the repair shop in order to get it fixed, and she was willing to pay for the fee. To which I'm very reluctant to do. No, not because I'm lazy. Nor is it because I think of it not as my responsibility because I don't care about my bike. But because I have planned from a long time ago that I will fix the bike the first time I get money on my hands.

To give a bit of context. Because of my unemployment, my family also helped me to pay a sum of this year's tax for the bike. To which again, I am forever grateful for. And I must admit that I am absolutely ashamed of it. I know that I have the responsibility to take care of the bike. But because of my inability to fulfill it, I need to rely on my family, the same time I relied on them to pay for the rest of the installments. I say this again and again, I'm forever grateful and thankful for their kindness, and this debt I could never pay for my whole life time. However, above everything else, *I am ashamed of myself,* because I couldn't fulfill my own duty and responsibility. This shame has become a burden that I carry even until today.

Back to my grandmother's request to me to fix it. I'm very reluctant to fix the bike, even when she was willing to pay the fee. I cannot bear anymore burden of shame on my heart and shoulders. Not only do I rely on my family to feed me, but now I need to rely on them to fix my bike? I cannot... I simply cannot.

However, it gets worse from there on. Seeing that I'm reluctant to do what she asked, my grandmother asked my uncle to do it instead. My whole family members have seen me as a useless leech already, and now my grandma wants to humiliate me further?

You may be thinking "what a pathetic person this guy is." YOU ARE RIGHT! I AM PATHETIC! I leech off my family, I'm being a burden to them, I couldn't repay their love to me! I AM FUCKING PATHETIC! I KNOW IT WITHOUT ANYONE TELLING ME!

(â€¦) And I want to find a solution for this.

I don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. I don't want to receive kindness, I want to GIVE kindness. But alas, right now I can only live as a beggar in my own house. Every day is a torture to my shameful existence. Every day I try to work. Often I would stumble, and often I would berate myself because of my failures.

I want to get out of this spiral. But my good works will never be enough to surpass my failures and shame throughout the day. It's like I always try to bring in 10 boxes every day to only have 100 boxes taken away at the same time. I'm always at the negative!

And now, I got humiliated by my own grandma because she thinks that I don't care about my bike at all. I hate myself for being weak. And I hate those who can only humiliate me even when they are not aware of it. There is no longer love for me in this house.

If there is no longer love for me in this house, then so be it. They have exhausted their love to me, and likewise I have exhausted my love for them. I cannot... I cannot live in this house anymore. I need to get out. I need to find my own living. I need to cut out my ties with this damned family. If they hate me, then fine! I will get out!

I understand that these are my knee-jerk reaction to this shameful situation. I don't think I will be able to get out of the house and find my own out there. I will continue to try to find a living here so that I can feed myself and pay my own share of rents. But, it will stop there as I won't be part of this family beyond the point where we share the same roof. I've had enough all this. I want to live. I want to deserve to live. I live by my own accord and values. I will not live on this shame. I want to bring all of my energy to the works that I care, not to think about this humiliation and a feeling of undeserving of love and life.

---

Even though I say all of that, if I say that I will never love my family ever again because of this humiliation, I couldn't do it. Even to those who have mistreated me the worst way, if there is an opportunity for me to be kind, I **will** do it. When I think that I won't love them anymore because of my humiliation, I feel as if my heart is severely saddened by it as it is not the will of God.

Therefore, the only thing that I can do is for me to continue bear this burden of humiliation and shame. For to abandon it in the middle of the road is simply cowardly. This is *my* burden, and I won't let anyone else other than me bear it. I will not run away from it, and I want to live with it. Because I looked at the cross and I see my Lord there.

If we are talking about humiliation, there is no other human who bears humiliation and shame any greater than the Lord Jesus Christ. He is God who is willing to come down to the earth. He humbles Himself down to become a human and live among them. He teaches them, He loves them, and He forgives them. And in the end, He dies for us all in order to fulfill the Lord's wish and plan of salvation.

He was humiliated throughout His walk on earth. He was rejected here and there, He was spit on, He was ridiculed, and His clothes were taken from Him to make it a lottery. But even then, His love to mankind and His willingness to fulfill the plan of salvation is far greater than His shame. Hence why He chose to bear it, to endure, and to live with it.

That is what my Lord does, and I shall do the same. I will live with this shame my whole life. Even if there is no love in this house anymore for me, I won't run out of love for them. I may be a leech right now, but when I'm able to take care of myself by the will of God, then I will take care of those who are in the same position as I am right now. Because I know how it feels to be miserable and pathetic. And I will show them hope in the form of Jesus Christ. I will tell them the stories where I was so ashamed of myself, and even write about it in documents such as this, and finally how I got out from it because I looked at the cross.
