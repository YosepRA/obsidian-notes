Why do people get creative? Why do people *choose* to be creative?

This question has been in my mind whenever I feel this sort of listlessness that is bordering to laziness when I'm supposed to continue on walking in life and be creative. I feel the lack of purpose in what I create. I can feel how hollow my creations are as I continue to struggle and write one more line, or draw one more stroke. Inevitably, I come back yet to this same question that has been all too familiar to my heart and ear.

This sense of futility in my craft makes me doubt what I'm doing. My heart and mind stutter as I work, and I simply can't put my fullest effort to it. For what reason, I wonder, do I work and be creative? I know with absolute certainty that I don't do any of these to achieve any glory from this world, be it money, fame, prestige, and whatnot. However, I also know that I don't really have a particularly certain direction in my craft, at least for now. Then I realize, or at least, I drew the same conclusion as I was many times before. My creations are lacking goals in whom they should serve their purpose.

What's the use of creating a pet shop app if no one is going to use it? What's the use of drawing a wholesome manga if I can picture in my head to share my work to others and let them read it? **Who is going to use my works?** It all boils down to this one question.

I'm not saying this as a mean of gaining audience just for the sake of attention and clout that it may bring. I don't create stuff just because I want many people to use it. My answer for this remains the same, that even if only one person finds my creation to be useful, that it is helping them and make their life a tiny bit easier, then it is all I can ask for. Truly... And if somehow, my creation is not useful to anyone at all, then I would just simply move on to the next work. Although my creations *may* harm others in ways that is not my intention. However, I will be absolutely sure that I will never create something out of intention of harming anyone at all.

Therefore, I create so that *somehow* my creations can be of help to anyone at all.

However... I find out today that this may not be enough.

I get reminded of something that happened in my first job, which is also my one cornerstone of why I chose to become a web developer. Sadly enough, I seem to not put it deeply enough in my heart so that I can remember it every day.

That was a time when I work as a storage staff for a bakery shop in my local town. In order to produce breads, the storage section of the company must make an order of what and how many breads to produce for the next business day. Therefore, in the afternoon of the previous day, the storage manage will make a list of such order and send it to the factory so that they can produce it early in the next morning.

In order to make such a list, the storage manager must make an estimation of how much raw materials such as flours, butter, egg, and whatnot to produce a certain type of bread and a certain quantity of it. Let's just say a plain toast would need 300 grams of flour, 50 grams of butter, and 3 pieces of egg. That plain toast along with many assortments of bread will sum up the amount of raw materials needed for the next day production. These data is going to be useful when the storage section is counting the raw materials from the data against what is currently present in the storage.

The job of the storage manager is to make said list of bread orders every day on the afternoon. The storage manager, who was obviously my superior at the time, would work on a laptop and open a plain Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet contains a list of bread type and the amount of materials it needs. Mind you, this is a *plain* spreadsheet. There wasn't any fancy stuff in it. Therefore, my manager would look at this list every day and count the materials manually with calculators at hand. This whole process often took about 30 minutes each day, and it would often lengthen because, well, she was a manager and it is not rare for her to have a bit more work at the wildest time possible.

I saw that routine every day and I honestly feel curious about it. How would it be had my manager had a way to shorten the time needed for her to make bread order list every day? Then perhaps she could relax a bit more in the afternoon because making a bread order would often be the last thing she would do before going home.

Then I notice the idea of spreadsheet. I was never a sophisticated spreadsheet person, even to this day. However, I know enough calculation technique to write a spreadsheet to calculate those bread orders every day. Then in my spare time, I would tinker with the laptop and write a rough draft. Long story short, I found a way to write a spreadsheet to fulfill my goal. The spreadsheet would only require its user to input the quantity of bread for each type. Say one day you would want 200 orders of plain toast and 300 orders of chocolate donuts. The spreadsheet will then output the total amount of flour, butter, egg, *et cetera* and they are ready to be printed. It was truly a simple multiplication table that any person with elementary level of Excel could make it with their eyes closed.

I showed this spreadsheet to my manager and somewhat shyly suggested her to try it out. Honestly, I was so scared and timid that my manager would find it silly for me to even spend time making it. However, what came next has truly become the cornerstone of my often forgotten reason as to why I chose to become a creative person at all.

My manager was a professional at her work. Therefore, she is often strict with me and my colleagues when managing the storage. Not to mention that she is somewhat stone-faced and not easy to impress. 

However, what I saw that day truly betrays all of my expectations of her. She tried using my spreadsheet and work on to write a bread order. And the whole process only took **5 minutes** compared to the usual 30 minutes. To say that she was astonished was a literal understatement. She was frozen at first as she realized how much quicker it had been for her to finish writing a bread order. Shortly after that, she was thanking me profusely for making the spreadsheet. She would complain about how much of a Godsent the spreadsheet was as she can now rest a bit more at the end of the work day with the help the new spreadsheet. Then after that, she would preach to many of my colleagues of how my spreadsheet has helped her. My colleagues then congratulate me one after another for such an achievement. My manager would then continue to be happy for about a week and share her happiness with many more people she encountered.

From what I experience in this particular day, I can still remember it even to this day. And my experience on that day was truly, TRULY, a feeling of happiness in its purest form. It was happiness that makes me jump joyfully. It was happiness that lead not to arrogance and pride that I can flaunt it to others, but it was a happiness that drove me to my knees thanking God.

This was creativity in its purest form. I believe it to be the case and one of the truth of this world.

So, what can I learn from this? Creativity is not only the desire to create, and the skill and persistence to work for it, but it also requires compassion in which you direct your creative energy to. I'm basically saying, creativity needs an outlet. Being creative for only oneself is almost useless. Because it is rare for one to have problems that would require ourselves to find a solution. It would be more frequent for us to see problems in other people's life because each person will have their own problems. 

Basically, I alone could only have one or two problems. However, ten other people would each have one or two problems of their own. More problems there are, more solutions to offer. Not to mention that solving someone else's problem can be more fulfilling. Because helping someone else is an inherently good thing to do, a good trait that is written in our heart by God since the beginning of time. Therefore, helping other people with sincerity of our heart will always yield reward for our heart.

Now, here lies the problem. I am an introvert. Even though I don't have any problems of speaking with others, but I'm having the hardest time when it comes to *initiating* a conversation. You can call it plain shyness, but once the conversation begin, I would rarely have problems that is hindering my communication ability. Once the conversation is going, I could say what I want to say, and I could listen to what other people are saying. The activity of conversing itself was never a problem, the initiative to strike a conversation has been my primary social problem since the dawn of age.

All of this come primarily from my fear of rejection. Ahh... I go back to this spot yet again with one of the biggest fear of my life, the thorn that is stopping me from living a good life.

Yes, I fear facing other people. What would I do if other people refuse to talk to me? What if it turns out I couldn't provide any meaningful value to them? What if I end up bothering them and taking their precious time with my meaningless thoughts? What if not only do they refuse to listen and talk, but also regard my existence as a bother for them, and that I don't deserve to be listened by anyone?

You get what I mean. The point is, if I can't take the initiative, it will be very difficult for me to not only talk to other people, but also expand my world. Because I can feel the listlessness in my life at this moment is mainly caused by my shrinking world. That I've known the nook and crannies of my current world and I can't get excited or motivated enough so that I can continue on living with purpose. In this state of life, it is important for anyone to expand their world and experience new things in life. Right now, I'm clearly lacking on it and I'm lacking the facilities, or perhaps the courage, to get to know more about the world through what other people do with their life.

I created that spreadsheet because I feel compassion with my storage manager who always do the somewhat boring task every afternoon. It stars off with sympathy, and it ends up with an effort to help and a solution. The solution which really didn't take so much out of me turns out to be a world of help to my manager. 

That effort to connect with others, understand their problems, be compassionate with them, and offer a solution is one of, if not the most important part of being a creative person, even more important than the raw skill that you may bring to the table. The intention to connect itself is golden. And the honest creative power is what it takes to express such compassion.

I guess, I need to find an answer with my overall shyness. I never hope to become an extrovert and/or an extreme social butterfly. I just want to have enough courage so that I can connect with more people, and therefore, expand my world. Please pray that God will take me to the answer.
