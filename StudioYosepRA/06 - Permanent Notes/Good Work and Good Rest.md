I'm feeling groggy. Not only do I skipped writing both morning pages and afternoon pages for a few days, but also my weekend went rather awfully. No, nothing went wrong that is so bad that it drives me to the ground. It's just that my weekend, despite myself filling it with my usual activities, didn't feel as fulfilling as before. 

I spent my weekend playing games and consume its content, which I couldn't do on weekdays, in a relaxed pace. Meaning, I try to enjoy the game's story by immersing myself to it, entertaining any sort of detours that may come while playing the main content, and taking notes for my exploration on that day. For me, this is the best way to enjoy a video game. Not by consuming as much content as I can in a single sitting, but rather immersing myself in whatever bite-sized content there is.

Playing games with full immersion for a short 1 or 2 hours on weekend often recharges my energy quite reliably. If I do these on Saturday evening and throughout Sunday, then come Monday, I would come out refreshed and ready to face another week. But today, I don't feel the same.

I always believe that a good rest can only come after a good hard work. People who spend their days working hard with their bones will have their food tastes amazing, and their rest time feels fulfilling. It's a natural cycle of life beings. That means, if one doesn't work throughout the day to tire himself out, then their rest time would hardly be fulfilling. It's like you are trying to sleep, but your body still has some energy left. Therefore, it ends up with you sleeping later than usual as you wait too long for your body to enter the sleep state. And it ends up screwing your sleeping cycle.

Working your days out is essential to a healthy life. An inactive mind and body could not only mess up one's life cycle, but also deteriorate it even further if let alone. If I don't do anything, then it's inevitable for my mind and body to rot.

At the same time, I also understand that there are days when I feel like there is nothing to be done. But now that I think about it, they are just a bunch of excuses. There is *always* something to be done. Whenever I reflect on myself, I always find something I want to do, something I want to learn, and something I want to build. My problem is, truly, my laziness and inaction. Whenever I'm faced with an option of doing and not doing, I would choose the latter much more frequently than the former. And that leads to the miserable state that I am for months now.

There are indeed something I want to do, I want to learn, and I want to build. Even with all those desires, I still don't know where it will lead me. But the longer I wait, the longer I realize how unnecessary it is to yearn for motivation to do anything in life.

Perhaps, I must come to accept the fact that I will never be able to truly envision a future for whatever work I choose to do at any time. Say I want to finish my personal website soon. I must accept that finishing this website won't make any significant changes later down the road. The same goes with learning more about coding algorithm, system architecture, music, art, etc. 

Perhaps, it would be wiser for me to not try to achieve anything or go anywhere. But rather, I should do it because I like doing it. Because that is my first thoughts whenever I reflect on those desires. I want to do, learn, and build something because I simply like it.

I may not envision where I would go, but whatever I choose to work on today will definitely lead me to a place. If I fill choices that are good, then it shall lead to a good place too. For that, I can only rely on God.
