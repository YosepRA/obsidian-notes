Discoveries and knowledge that are kept only to oneself is as good as having none of those in the first place. Imagine Newton kept his silence about the law of gravity, what would be our current understanding of modern physics? Imagine if Einstein kept his theory of relativity shelved within his desks, how would we see our universe without it other than some planets floating mindlessly throughout the space? It was their simple desire to share their findings, to discuss it with other people that brings justice to our world view in developing our vast knowledge as a species.

I'm an introvert, and I've been struggling a whole lot when it comes to sharing my works. I simply can't imagine going to my friends and say "Hey, look at what I build this week. Can I ask you what you think about it?". Therefore, I have never shared any of my works to other people. Or at least as far as I can remember myself.

I would be lying if the desire to share my work was never there. It's always there. I too want to share my work as much as I want to offer my opinions on other people's works. I have to admit that there is fear involved here. A fear that is rooted from fear of rejection. What if I get humiliated because of my works? What if it's not good enough? What if it's going to plummet me even further down than I already am because of how bad my works are?

I've been plagued with this feelings for as long as I can remember. And least to say, it hasn't been a healthy mindset to have on daily basis. Every day, I discount both my effort and results. Thinking that they are not even as good as a scribble of a five year old child. This massive sense of insecurity is always there in my arm's length, as I still can't find an answer to this problem.

This is not to say that I've found a solution to this problem in this note. I always knew that sharing one's work is a virtue in itself. A desire to both listen to what people want to say, and the same goes to the desire to express oneself is the height of virtue of knowledge and creativity. Only by listening to others' ideas do my knowledge expands, and only by offering my ideas that I can both express my understanding and also help other people whom shares their works with me.

I realize that this simple desire to share, to grow together between different people should be the main reason why we should express our ideas in the first place. Having desire is justice, and even more so for a desire to express oneself. Not to flaunt and trumps over other people, but a humble desire to grow together.

If this were to be true, then it would be great for me to find a community where I can listen to people's ideas, and express my own without restraint or fear of criticism and rejection. In that humble environment where I know that everyone wants to grow together do I can grow myself, both as a creative person, and also as a human being.
