What do you see as the good fruit of your life? Is it the great results of your work? Is it the achievements of your endeavor? Or is it some glory in your field of expertise? What do you see as the good fruit, something which makes you say "Ah... This is the result of my work. And I'm proud of that."?

This has been my way of thinking, probably for a long time, until I reflect on myself in my prayer just now in the evening of this day. 

Let's set up a context for a bit. At this point, I'm still as jobless and broke as the last time I moan about it in a post such as this. And I'm working my way to get me out of this difficult times. I'm currently working, or to be more precise, have my focus split between honing my skill as a software developer and building a practical project to get me a job.

I have made a commitment to truly study about software engineering and computer science. I want to dive so deep that this life time isn't nearly enough for me to accomplish any sort of mastery of it. However, I also realize that with how much time it is required, I don't believe that I could have any practical way to turn this knowledge into some jobs that could get food on the table for my family.

With that in mind, therefore I created a plan to also build projects which will fill up my portfolio so that I can showcase my skills. However, I don't have the confidence to work on those projects with my current state of rusty skills.

Therefore, I found myself in this cycle between a plan of working on a project, but since I'm not confident in my skills, I go to study a bit more. But then when I study, I feel guilty of not doing anything practical to get me out of this difficult times.

That is basically the gist of my whole mental warfare which I'm currently facing.

This evening, I spent my time praying to God. I shared my thoughts and feelings to Him, similar to what has been written above, and I asked for His wisdom. For He gives wisdom generously to those who asked. And He gave me one. Which is the good fruits, the *true* good fruits, in the eyes of God.

As I mentioned in the first paragraph of this post, I see good fruits as some sort of achievements in life. Something which I can be proud of, and honestly, something which I can *boast* of to others (and perhaps to God as well). As much as I don't think consciously of all these arrogance, when I dig deep into my heart, that's what I found. And surely for that is not approved by God.

I was seeing good fruits as the *result* of my good works. Results in terms of, again, something which I can boast of. To give an example, say I'm working on a project, if I put my whole and earnest heart, surely the result will be of something brilliant, a masterpiece of sorts which I can be proud and boast of to others (and God, again). Saying as if I was the one who worked on this, saying I was the one who poured my whole hearts into it, and saying God *desires* for me to create this masterpiece.

While most of it are true to a certain extent, which God is the only reason I could ever done such a good work. However, it is certainly *not His will* so that I can boast of any of that.

Therefore, having a mindset of doing good, earnest works so that having a masterpiece of a result is the *only* possible result is not good in the eyes of God. If that is the case, then what is seen as the true good fruits which He desires? The answer was *never the results, but the sincere heart instead.*

Let me explain. Let's go back to the previous example where I'm working on a project. The good fruits was never about how much of a masterpiece the end results would be, but rather my sincere heart and honest works that I put *while building the project.* The sincerity of heart is the good fruits which God seeks. 

No matter how much earnest work one have put, the result could be anything it wants to be. One day, you put an earnest work on a project, and it results in the most mediocre one. Another day, it could be a good one. Another day, it could be a great one! Yet another day... It could be a disappointing one. And you know what? That's okay. For God desires not the result, but the earnestness of heart when we serve Him.

Our Father in Heaven is our most loving father. Would you as a father ridicule your daughter for drawing a silly scribbles on paper? No, of course not. You saw your daughter were having fun scribbling with crayons in her hands. How could you laugh and make fun of her? No, you would never! You would hang those scribbles on a refrigerator and make it a family heirloom for all you care. And you won't care how silly it looks and how many people will laugh at you for doing such things. Why? *Because you are proud of your daughter for her earnest heart.* You are sincerely happy because of the sincerity of heart of your daughter's creation.

If all loving father on earth can do that, how can our Heavenly Father not do that same, if not more? The Spirit of God loves the most not of the end result of our works, but rather the obedience and sincerity of heart when we, as children of God and the Spirit's human agent, are listening to His voice and do His commands. The Spirit of God is happy when He knows that He is being listened to and mankind are doing His will. Just like when you are happy for being listened to and have a great and productive discussion with your peers where you respect each other's voice.

The good fruits, the *true* good fruits in the eye of God is our earnest and honest heart. That's it. Abandon the thoughts of having the greatest results. But rather, open your heart and ears to His voice, listen to His commands, do what is required of you, and do it earnestly with all of your heart. We, as children of God and human agents for the Spirit, it is all we are required of, to do good works and bear good fruits.
