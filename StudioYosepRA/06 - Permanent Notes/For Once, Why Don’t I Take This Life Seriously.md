For once... In my whole life... Why don't I take this life seriously?

I came upon a reflection on myself as I ponder how much of a mess my life is. I couldn't bring myself to do the works that I need to do. Nor can I direct myself to a destination that is good. Everything is a drag. I'm doing something, yet I know that I don't do my best on it. Then I ask a question, is it always like this? Is life always such a drag for me? Have I never taken this life seriously at all?

The answer for that is, surprisingly, yes and no. I have instances in life where I worked myself to the bone. However, compared to the days where I live it such as what I'm doing right now, the good works are miniscule compared to the lazy, unserious days.

I recall the days of my school. It was junior and high school, in particular. When I was in elementary school, I was regarded as one of the best students in that school year. I would constantly go edge to edge with my peers to seize the top 10, or not rarely top 5 of the year. I studied well in those years. I would spend my night time studying productively. I didn't spend like 7:00 to 11:00 PM studying like a maniac. No. I would study for 2 to 3 hours a day, doing my homework and studying a bit of extra material. Even in the exam periods, I wouldn't study past a few exercises and be done with it. However, I can feel that those were times well spent in my life. A period of time where I spend my earnest effort to squeeze the life energy within me. A time where I can confidently say that I was doing my absolute best.

It's a different story when I enter junior-high school. Because of my elementary school days, I entered one of the most prestigious school in my city. I took the entrance exam head on and I did well on it. I thought it was going to be the same story for me as I was in elementary school. However, this is not the case at all.

As expected of a prestigious school, the brilliant kids were also there with me. I can't recall exactly the order of these things that I'm about to write, but there are two things that are true. One, I didn't do as well in my junior-high than in my elementary school. And two, I stopped studying seriously altogether.

As for why it happened, again, I couldn't recall the exact order of it. It could be that I feel discouraged by the competition. Perhaps, this also lead to my first experience of online gaming. And from then on, it was a cycle of laziness one after the other.

In the first periods of my junior-high, I would rank for about 15-20% of the whole year. However, in those whole years while I was there, I would get as low as 45-50%. In short, I was an absolute mediocrity. Again, this was an instance in my life where I didn't take my school life seriously as I chose to focus on "enjoying" it. And my way to indulge, and utmost certainly "escaping", was online gaming.

I won't write a lot of about my gaming days that started from my junior-high, and it is still going even today. But, compared to my elementary school days, rather than spending my night time studying, I would open up Dota 2 to play games with my friends. Long story short, I indulge myself too much that I become a mediocre bum that I was in those years.

Next is my high-school years. Because of my unserious junior-high stint, I don't have as much choice when it comes to high school. I failed the entrance exam for my top 2 choice of high schools. Again, not surprising now that I'm recalling it. In the end, I entered a school that is not as good. It was not as good of a school that the people there, teachers and students alike, were shocked to know that I was from this certain prestigious junior high school. Whenever I was asked the reason why I took such a turn and choose this school, I would answer that I think this school is my best option at the moment, and I wanted to be there. While the truth is that I was rejected by my top 2 choices, and I didn't want to go an extra mile to try another exam for another school.

Compared to my junior high, the students in my high school is not as brilliant as my junior high. To put it simply, even when I'm not doing my best at all, I would still rank 1 to 3 on each exam period. In fact, in my graduation exam, I ranked number 1 from the whole year. Yes, I studied a bit for the final exam, but it was not even close to the tears and sweat in my elementary school years. 

However, even though I ranked first in that final exam, my score is actually pathetic. My average score was about 70% of 100%. While now that I think about it, if I truly took my high school seriously and study hard for it, it would be easy for me to score at least 95%. I'm not underestimating anything at all. Recalling the materials that appeared in the final exams, it would be very easy for me to score that much. It was because I'm not used to studying and I have not faced enough of said materials through exercises, as I did in my elementary school, that I wasn't optimal in my effort.

Sure, all of these experience of the "should have, could have," I do feel regretful of these. However, this regret is only one part of the pathetic life that I've been living up until now.

*Sigh...* I don't want to berate myself in this note. However, this is the truth that I haven't done much that is worth calling "my best." Sure, the year 2019-2020 was a brilliant year where I exceled in my first studies as a web developer. In that year, I basically obliterated some of the technical books that make me a developer as I am today. I'm not saying that I am a brilliant developer right now. But, 80% of my knowledge and intuition to solve problems came from year 2019-2020 study session. Meaning, ever since then, I haven't felt the same glory and growth as I was in that brilliant year.

That year was one of my finest year indeed. I would wake up in the morning, open my decade old laptop, and start coding. Even my current several magnitude better PC has never work as hard as my old laptop in that year. I feel guilty of not using this PC to its best capabilities. 

But back to the story, ever since 2020, I have never felt my heart as I was in that year. I couldn't feel the fire that drove me to wake up in the morning and grind through the difficult books in my waking moments. I couldn't feel the same yearning and desire that drives me to do such a difficult thing. 

And I must say, what I did in year 2019-2020 was *the most difficult* thing I have ever done in my life. Those times are no joke. That was probably the first time I choose to do something in my life. That was the first time I would break the conventional path of my life, and chose to dedicate my whole life and being to become a web developer.

I didn't take the easy path and I became a burden to my family while I was not making any money (well, it's not a different story today). However, I was willing and my heart was full of desire to devour everything web development in that time. Therefore, I can see that my desire at the time was justified. And even though I haven't returned to the Lord in those time, I can feel that He was helping me a ton too, even when I don't realize it.

Now, let's go back to the present. I am in the same state as I was in 2020. However, the only same part is that I am being a burden to my family because I couldn't feed myself. Ah... It's so pathetic that I want to cry. But I must write this, hoping that I can find a solution. I don't feel the heart that I used to have when it comes to pursuing this web development path. Everything I do feels like a drag. Everything I do feels like my limbs are chained, and I couldn't move forward.

Then I recall the parallels in this passing days as I was in my junior and high school days. I am spending my days listlessly as I watch it past, the same as I was in my school days. I can feel how much untapped potential which I had at the time, as I am feeling at this time. And also, I can feel the regret of not living my whole life right now as I was in my school years. I can feel it that in years to come, or even in my death bed, I would recall today just like how my present self recall my school days. A face full of regret and realization of how pathetic my life has been.

What could have been had I taken the challenge in my junior high and study as seriously as I was in elementary school? What could have been had I pour my heart and self out to devour everything computer science, art, and music as I was in year 2020? What could have been had I live this life seriously.

For once... What could have been had I taken this life seriously? Where would I go? Where would I be? What would I be doing right now? What would my future looks like?

The answer to all those questions lies on the path ahead. It lies on a path of fire. Once you walk into it, you would feel how hot and putrid it is. The fire would break your skin and burn your eyes. However, there lies the answer you are seeking. The answer which you once find in that brilliant years. The answer which you once find, when you take this life seriously, and pour your whole life being into the pot of life.
