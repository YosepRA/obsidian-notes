What matters is not the amount of books one has read, but whether one can truly understand what they are reading, and they can explain it in their own words. Ideally, for many times to come.

It's a glorified life advice for people to read an X amount of books every week. It's glamorous when you are able to boast the amount of books you have read this week, or how you have burned your candles overnight to read this one particular intellectual book to make you sound smart and hard-working. While the truth is that these people are more likely to not be able to recite what the content of the book other than a few catchy lines here and there, again to make them sound smart. Oh, mind you, I'm not ridiculing any one of my peers or any one of you. I would only ridicule myself. And this paragraph perfectly surmised my "learning" journey so far.

I have boasted of reading a series of self-help books that are the top of the shelves. I've read Napoleon Hill's *The Law of Success,* Dale Carnegie's *How to Stop Worrying and Start Living,* or even the one with absurd titles such as *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck* by Mark Manson. You ask me some popular self-help books, and it's likely that I've read those too. But do I understand what I read? Can I recite what I *thought* I understood from those books? The answer is a big fat, NO.

It's very much saddening to realize the weight of having read that much books, but unable to recite what I've understood from the book aside from a few catchy lines. It's like a whole bunch of junks lying around my brain with no road to access it. They are clutters, simply said. And it's more shameful that I have only applied little of wisdom that I gained from those books, making it a waste of time and effort to read them all.

I used to write summarization of books that I've read using a simple list of pointers. Whenever I find an interesting line, I would not only underline it in the book itself, but I'd also copy it to a separate Word document. I thought it was enough, I thought I was being productive. But alas, that is not the case at all. I may have copied those lines, but I understood little of it if I reread it. Again, making all those time and effort of reading those books pretty much wasted.

To address this issue, I'm building a habit of writing mini-essays, like this one you are reading right now. I've never written any "proper" paper or essay before. Therefore perhaps, these writings leans more to diaries than papers, my rather unfiltered thoughts. But I genuinely make an effort to write these mini-essays in a way that is easy to read and contain as much insights as I can. In short, I'm doing my best to write it properly and explain what I want to say about my understanding of a certain topic as best as I can.

I got this inspiration of writing mini-essays in a timely manner from a YouTube video made by [Odysseas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4YjXJVzoZY&pp=ygURb2R5c3NlYXMgb2JzaWRpYW4%3D). And from that video, I learned the existence of a book titled *How to Take Smart Notes* by Sönke Ahrens.

If you truly care about the books that you are reading, then I can't recommend you enough to watch Odysseas' video and Mr. Ahrens book. These resources have simply transformed how I study. Not only the primary writing habit itself, but also how I approach many different resources. I no longer read books just because I want to speed-read it and boast it to my friends. I read books, listen to lectures, and watch video tutorials because I truly want to make those information stick in my head. And by writing mini-essays, I can build an ever-growing repositories of knowledge. Of topics and materials that I've studied before, stored in a form of mini-essays that I wrote using my own words and my understanding of said topics.

What matters is not the amount of books one has read, but whether one can truly understand what they are reading, and they can explain it in their own words. Ideally, for many times to come. This has been my lifelong goal only recently. And it is my greatest desire to continue learning and growing no matter what age my physical body may have.
