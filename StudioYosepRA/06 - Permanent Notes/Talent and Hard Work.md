## Talent and Hard Work

"People who don't put in the minimum amount of effort have no right to be jealous of people with talent. Those who fail do so only because they cannot imagine the effort it takes to be successful at achieving their goals."

*\- Yukinoshita Yukino (Wataru Watari. My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected, Vol. 1, Ch. 03. Yen Press.)*

It's easy to come up with a view, or even prejudice at this point, that people with talents have it easy in life. That these so called geniuses' achievements were all because of their talents which they are born with. It's easy to see as such that onlookers can only see the surface and end result of it all, and ignore the necessary effort beneath it that makes it possible for these people to do what they do.

I have a few talents. I'm not saying this to brag or anything, but I don't think of myself little enough to discount activities that are easy for me to do. I say studying comes rather easy for me. Of course, looking at the current context and situation of my life, I would've brought some questions to this belief. But it's more of a case where I haven't been using my talents enough to carry myself through the sea of life. But have this particular talent helped me and make my life easier? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the ease of study have helped me in numerous circumstances in life. And no because I simply haven't used enough of this talent so that I can live a proper life.

Looking at it, where does the problem lie? **Yes, it's whether one uses their talents or not.** Based on the aforementioned prejudice, as long as people have talents, they should thrive and have it *easy* in life, don't they? But since people rarely realize, let alone use their talents for their own good, all they choose to do is lament of their own supposed shortcomings, and be jealous of those they deemed as talented and having it easy in life. 

Now that we think about it, it's unfair for people to put geniuses in a pedestal and worship or insult them for their achievements. I don't deny the existence of talent, or that some things can come easily for some people. Again, it's whether one uses their talents or not that makes the whole world of difference. As it's something that I need to remind myself quite so often.

That being said, this is the first note that I write using Obsidian. It's my effort to get better at studying by writing mini-essays and notes to record *everything* that I found interesting and have a desire to dig deep into. Therefore, it's my effort and hard work to utilize my so called talents. Not because I want to thrive, but because I want to live a wholehearted life, with both my strengths and weaknesses.
