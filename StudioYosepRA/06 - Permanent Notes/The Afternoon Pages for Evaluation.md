There is morning pages, then there is afternoon pages. After writing morning pages for two days in a row, I see some quite noticeable improvements in my cognitive mind as I go through the day. 

I found out about morning pages from a book *The Artist's Way* by Julia Cameron. And the author claimed that writing for a short time in the morning before starting the day will help us flush out our mind. Basically, it's a place where we can speak out our concerns after we wake up. The purpose for that is because once we write our thoughts, then it becomes a reality, and we can't simply ignore it. 

Compared to when I start the day without writing an entry of morning pages, these lingering thoughts will often nag me throughout the day. It's a feeling as if there is something in the back of my mind that needs to be addressed. Sometimes, I may know what it is. But oftentimes, I don't. When there is something nagging in my mind, and I don't understand what it is, then it becomes an unconscious burden to my mind that prevents me from spending my conscious thoughts peacefully and focusing on my works instead.

That is at least my personal take about morning pages that correlates well enough with the points expressed by Mrs. Cameron in her book. Writing morning pages for two days has indeed become helpful for me to write out my concerns in the morning. When my concerns are laid out, I no longer need to guess what it is anymore. And when my concerns are laid out, I can think about what to do to solve these problems.

This is much more productive than having to guess my problems every time. By understanding what I'm concerned with, it's more likely for me to find a solution, or more precisely, guided by God to the solution. That way, I don't have to bear the unnecessary burden in my work throughout the day, and I can walk the day peacefully and put more focus on my works.

Since I saw how helpful morning pages have been, I find it necessary to also have a way to evaluate what has happened throughout the day. Hence the afternoon pages, which this entry is the first of all. The basic rules are exactly the same as morning pages. The difference is the time and context. Afternoon pages are written in, well, afternoon. Often at the end of the work day, but now, I'm writing one at around 18:00. I could choose to continue on working after this, but writing an afternoon page at this time is as good as writing exactly at the end of the day.

The goal for afternoon pages is to evaluate the happenings of the day. Whenever there is something important that I can talk about, I would write a simple list in a document titled *What Happens Today.* Then at the time of writing an afternoon page, I would look at this list and see my findings throughout the day, and see whether I can expand it.

Hopefully with afternoon pages, I could be more conscious of what's happening throughout the day. So that my days won't be spent unconsciously where I couldn't recall what has happened in it. Because when I can't recall of what I went through the day, it's a sad feeling to have that I may have wasted one more day living unconsciously. Therefore, writing afternoon pages is my humble attempt to record the day, simply as that.

That's it for today. I have addressed about following my daily routine schedule, fixing my sleeping cycle, and I have also finished the tablet layout for my personal website, StudioYosepRA. It has been a successful day for me where I accomplished a lot more than I have for quite a while. So I'm thankful to God for enabling me to do all of these. 

I will certainly build on this habit, so that I can regain order in my life. Thank you for reading.
