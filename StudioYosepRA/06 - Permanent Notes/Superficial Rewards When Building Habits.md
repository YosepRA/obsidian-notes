We are more likely to do activities that rewards us. If what we are doing is either giving the rewards that we are expecting for, or it gives a feeling of satisfaction, we are likely to repeat the same process to achieve the same rewards.

This is the main theory of a field of habit building. The idea is to build a good habit, we should reward ourselves after we successfully manage to push through our willpower to do said good habits. For example, we can reward ourselves with a glass of our favorite orange juice after workout. Since we love that cold orange juice out of the fridge after being sweaty with workout, we would feel motivated in repeating our workout session, however difficult it may be, so that we can have that one glass of orange juice.

This way, we hope we can develop a positive cycle of working out because we know what we will get at the end of it. To an extent, yes, building good habits using this method can certainly work. I don't have anything to argue about it. Especially in a field that is very much unknown to me. Unfortunately, whenever I deliberately attach a reward for a habit that I try to build, I find it difficult to maintain it. Meaning that I still need to spend way too much willpower every time I start doing the activities for the day.

The reason why I feel it to be difficult to continue pushing myself is the superficial feeling of whatever rewards which I choose. I feel them to be too cheap, not in terms of monetary value, but rather a reason of action. Why should I reward myself with a glass of orange juice every time I finish working out? Why should I reward myself with a glass of milk coffee whenever I finish studying? Now, what if I can no longer afford said rewards? What if one day my orange juice or milk coffee runs out? Should I then no longer do said habits because I no longer have the carrot at the end of it?

To give a crude example of it all, developing good habits using this methods always feels the same as training my dog with treats in hand. Whenever my dog put his paw on my hand, I will give him a treat. Or when he successfully differentiate between strangers and neighbors who were passing by my house by his barks, I would give him treats too. It may work on pets, but I don't think it has been working for me at all. My dog may not know that I deliberately give him snacks whenever he is being a good boy, but I know that I'm doing the same with myself with my supposed habits and rewards.

Good habits should not require us to have a "clear" rewards to motivate us. We all know what good habits do in our life, so we shouldn't need anything but a little push at the start. But we don't know that, or at least we don't want to acknowledge it. Because humans are creatures that always seeks clarity. If there is no clear rewards in the eye, then why bother doing it at all? We know a good workout can give a feeling of relieve to our mind and body. We know an earnest study can give us a feeling of growth in our knowledge. *These are the real rewards.* The one we should strive for and the reason why we should keep our heads down and be earnest in building good habits in life. Because they are simply *good activities* to have in one's life.

Even more to that, good habits should've energized us along the way. It should enable us to enter the flow because we enjoy the time we spend doing such activities. We may grow tired over time, but we wouldn't feel as tired as when we push ourselves with our already limited willpower.

One of such activity in my life that I can do without as much as an initial little push is studying *and* writing, which is something that I'm currently doing at this moment as I write this sentence. It's a habit of writing smart notes which I read from *How to Take Smart Notes* by Sönke Ahrens.

I've always loved studying, and learning how to take good notes from Mr. Ahrens' book only further strengthen my love of studying, and further realization of how much I truly like reading books and absorbing knowledge from many different sources. By writing notes, especially using a software called *Obsidian,* I can actually feel that my knowledge is growing as much as the volume of notes that I've written over time.

I don't need to push myself to study and write, because perhaps writing has always come rather easily to me. But the point still stands, I don't need to motivate myself to study and write aside from the initial push to beat however much resistance I have in the morning. But after I open my book, or whatever study materials I have in hand, I can enter the flow quickly and easily.

At the base of it, I'm still using the theory of habit building, which is to reward ourselves after finishing our good habit in order to develop a positive cycle. However this time, the rewards doesn't feel superficial at all. I can see that I don't deliberately choose the rewards of "actually seeing my knowledge grow" and attach it to a stick in front of me. I do it because I love it.

Of course, all of this can be even greater if I also acknowledge that there are many habits that are worth doing and provide with the same level of existential satisfaction and not simply just a superficial material values, such as exercising. I may need to rely on so much more willpower to activities that I don't actually like. But I also believe that as I continue to push myself to not rely on cheap rewards, and motivate myself with the real rewards, I would grow to love this activities.

I should test this theory, however. Because we all know that it's easy to say than done.
