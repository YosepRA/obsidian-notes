I always ponder over reason and meaning of everything. Why do I wake up to day? What should I do with it? For what reason do I live the day? And what is the meaning of my works today?

This is a classic question of meaning. At one point, or even now without me knowing, I came to a conclusion that there is no such meaning in whatever I do. That whatever I do will end up in an endless void which voraciously swallow all of humankind's greatness and sins. That whatever I do will end up being nothing. This is simple and pure nihilism.

I'm a believer of God and I kneel before Him. It is written that we must give our life to the Lord. Therefore, everything we have to serve Him and those around us. I don't have a problem with it at all. I would love to dedicate all that I am, my talents, my strengths, and my flaws in order to serve my Lord and be the light of this world. Perhaps, this is coming from my lack of experience that I don't understand the meaning of service, or at least the *excitement* of service that the thought couldn't push me hard enough off my bed in the morning.

Then there is a question whether meaning is necessary at all. One would argue that we must let go of the pursue of meaning, and focus doing the good works. However, I couldn't reject the truth that man who is driven by meaning will go so much farther in life than those who don't.

I yearn for a morning where I get excited for the day. Because I know there is something I want to do and must do for today. The peace and thrill of knowing that my work will matter in doing good in this ruthless world. I yearn for that excitement.

So, what is the meaning of my work, then?

This morning, I found a statement "Good Men Works". It's a simple statement really which stated that good men *simply works* for the day. Regardless of their joy and hurt prior to that point, good men works anyway. Not in a pursue of anything, be it material or meaning, but it is simply what they do and what good men do.

This is not a point to boast for one's work for the day, in which it proves that one man's work is more than another man's work. It's a humble standpoint that men simply work, in whatever they do as long as they are good and honest works.

So, is there meaning in simply working? I would say, yes, there is. But it's not in a form that you and I expect it to see.

It doesn't come in any tangible way to describe this meaning. I mean, I came to a conclusion not too long ago in my writing "Who I Am" that doing creative work is simply an inevitability. I need no elaboration in deciding whether I should or should not be creative for today. I should do my creative works because it is simply *what I do.* There is no need for further elaboration in search of meaning than a willingness to just start and do it. And I reckon it is of the same line of thought with good men works.

There is no need for elaborate search of meaning in what we work on for today. Your willingness and determination to start and do it is enough to make the deed as meaningful as it will ever be. Because good men simply works as he lives for the day.
