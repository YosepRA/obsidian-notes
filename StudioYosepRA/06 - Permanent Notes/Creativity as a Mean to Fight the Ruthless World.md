"He (Jack Gilbert) told them that they must live their most creative lives as a means of fighting back against the ruthless furnace of this world."

I recently see creativity as an inevitability, meaning that it is not something I force into myself, but rather it is just simply who I am and how I choose to live. 

Jack Gilbert's idea of living one's most creative lives as a means to fight the cruel world is romantic, and somewhat endearing. We know how absurdly, ridiculously, and awfully cruel this world can be. To the point where pain is the clearest experience we would experience in our daily basis.

Pain and suffering is also an inevitability in this life. In a way, we must accept it. However, accepting it as it is without deep understanding could lead us to pure despair and nihilism, which is not the greatest feeling to have. We have an obligation to accept it, as in accepting it as part of life, but we also have the power and rights to *fight* it. And fighting through our creative prowess is one way to it.

What if I see my works as my way to brave the wind? As I walk in this treacherous desert, doing my works and live my most creative life is one of the only ways for me to keep on standing and rooted to the ground below. Once I manage to have a solid ground, I can then walk forward.

Creativity as a mean to fight. Hm... Yes. I do like how it sounds, and I like how it motivates me to keep on going and fighting. Not because I refuse to accept the ruthlessness of the world, but rather precisely because I understand how ruthless this world can be, I choose to fight by living my most creative life.
