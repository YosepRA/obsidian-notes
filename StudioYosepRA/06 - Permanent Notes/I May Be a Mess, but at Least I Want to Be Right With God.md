I don't know how many times I have started my notes with these sentences. There isn't much going on. I'm still a mess and I still can't find my way in life. Hmm... That's inaccurate. I know where I should be heading, but I'm hardly getting there. 

Every day feels like a drag where I need to continually kick my butt to get on to work on what I need to do. But even so, it's not rare for me to let myself be kicked in the butt just so that I don't need to do anything at all. The cycle continues on and on as I waste day after day.

I want to believe that life is simple. It's just my mind that overcomplicate things a hundred folds that cripples me from necessary actions to get life going. All I need to do is to simply "just do it" like the legendary Nike ad by Shia Labeouf. But alas, it seems to be not as simple for me. Or at least, I haven't decided to follow this wisdom wholeheartedly.

At this point, I want to live day by day. Even when I must face and accept the reality and confront the future, ultimately, I want to live for today and today only. And for what I have and what I can do for today, I want to do my absolute best. Because I believe that keep on keeping on from what I built yesterday and to keep myself moving is the best way to build for a better future. My only assurance for any sort of good future is my opportunity to do my best for today, and my decision to seize it.

I don't regard myself as a wise man. I mean, look at what I'm doing in life and you can see (or read) how much of a mess I am. However, I acknowledge that I know a fair bit, or at least enough about life that can make me live appropriately. However, again, I'm all about thinking and not at all about doing. This is my biggest concern for me to solve at this moment.

Because of my inaction, my life is full of uncertainties. Well, whose life isn't full of uncertainties anyway? We all deal with our own issues and challenges in life. I'm not more or less different than my neighbors. However, even when my life is full of doubts and uncertainties, at the very least, I want to be right with God.

I must say that my relationship with God is straining because of my disobedience and neglect to acknowledge Him in my life. Again, whenever there is something wrong between me and God, it's all my fault. I know that I haven't been a good child to Him, and I know that I have been a useless worker in His garden. I know that I haven't felt God's presence in my life. And I know that I'm feeling lonely right now even when I know that it isn't true.

However, whenever I took a pause from my worries and look at God's direction, I feel like my worries no longer matter. I may have a mountain of worries about my life, but when I put my God beside it, His glory surmounts and outshines any and all of my worries. Sure, my worries and challenges in life aren't going away. But at least I know that my God is watching me at every moment of my life, and He always fulfills all of my needs. Whenever I look at God and acknowledge His presence in holiness in my life, I feel like I can breathe and continue on living, knowing that I'm truly not alone in this world and facing problems on my own.

My life may be a mess and chock-full of uncertainties and worries at this moment, but at the very least, I want to be right with God. I must keep my eyes on Him at all times and never rid of Him out of my mind. Because He desires for me to live. Not because He wants to put burden on my heart and shoulders, but because He wants me and all of His children to know, that life is a blessing for those who are willing to take it with both hands. Indeed... Life is a blessing for those who are willing to take it.
