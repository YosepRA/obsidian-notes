I start late again today. Which is a shame because I slept and woke up at the right time today, and I had a chance to start the day much earlier than usual. In one part, I feel regretful. But on the other part, it is what it is, and I have the choice to continue the day the right way. That is what I intend to do by writing this note, which is something I feel reluctant to do, but ended up doing anyway.

Honestly, I don't have much to write about. I know that I should write anything in morning pages, like literally anything. So, what should I talk about?

I spent this morning by watching clips of Men in Black on YouTube. I watched a few movie clips from the 3rd movie. I have to say that Men in Black is definitely one of the classics. This trilogy is by no means a masterpiece. I certainly won't stand on a hill where I need to raise a case on it. However... This series is one that is very close to my heart. It's not like I spent a lot of time talking about it in the community in my youth. But I watched it on TV, and I believe the first movie stuck to me instantly at that time. The curiosity lead to the second movie, and then much later the third movie. Men in Black is special to me. I would definitely bring this series to my grave along with many other things that I hold precious to me.

Well, talking about MIB is quiet random indeed. But again, I don't have anything to talk about anyway because the tank is empty. What about the plan for today? Honestly, that feels empty too. I could go and read *You Don't Know JS*, I guess? Yeah, that is perhaps what I would do.

I apologize if this note feels empty. But I guess, this is one of those days. I will end the note here, even when 15 minutes hasn't passed yet. Thank you for reading.
