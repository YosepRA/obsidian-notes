Good questions that spark our curiosity often come from when we encounter a piece of knowledge that challenges our current understanding of said topic. I mean, that's what happened when people find out the earth is round instead of flat. When we do encounter a challenging point of our understanding, we would often question or outright doubt our understanding. If we entertain this train of thoughts, we may find ourselves an interesting question to answer.

Good questions can lead to a great discovery. But again, good questions can often come when we are getting outside our comfort zone, which is what we already know right now. Getting out of our comfort zone means that we have to entertain sometimes conflicting thoughts and ideas from the books or materials that we study. Most of them can be problematic, but some of them could entertain further thoughts and elaboration.

In order to welcome information outside of our comfort zone, it's required of us to keep an open mind. It's not that we must think any and all information outside of our understanding to be true. But instead, be open-minded enough so that we won't outright shut new information, and understand that whatever information that we are reading, they are written by authors with their own set of beliefs, biases, world view, and their own view of truth itself. Therefore, keep open-minded to not immediately shut new information, but also maintain an objective view of the bigger picture.

Sure, new information can not only challenge our current understanding, but they can also be outright problematic. It's tempting to instantly shut down these information, understandably so. When we do encounter such information, it's wise to at least acknowledge that they are written by an author with their own set of truth. Further than that, if we understand that the information can no longer be useful, it's also okay to leave it at rest. It's all the more so if the argument is a complete nonsense too.

In the end, curiosity requires us to be more open-minded. To be open-minded, we have to welcome sometimes uncomfortable information in our way. We always have the rights to entertain it by elaborating further and integrate it with our knowledge, or we can simply leave it alone had we deem it to be not as useful from that point on. But if we do entertain thoughts that are outside of our current knowledge, and we are willing to develop those thoughts further, we may find ourselves to discover great things at the end of it.
