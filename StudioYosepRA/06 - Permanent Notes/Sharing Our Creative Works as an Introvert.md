As an introvert, the hardest part of being a creative person is sharing my works. Just like everyone else, I have what it takes to be a creative person. I may not be the most talented out there, but I have the patience and determination to push through the creative process. That, at least, is true as long as I'm driven and motivated enough to push through the journey as uncertain as creative journey.

I concluded not too long ago that I don't need reason or motivation in order for me to be creative. I thought I could produce many creative works as long as I'm willing to be present in my desk and put my heads down. However, as time goes on, I was proven wrong time and again. I found out that I *do* need a reason to create stuff.

I talked about this motivation in my previous note *[[Creativity Without Compassion Is Useless.]]* To sum it up, creativity without an outlet is useless. Yes, you can be creative to solve your own problems. But, this can get stale very quickly because we rarely see so much problems in ourselves so that we need to create a bunch of stuff. Therefore, being creative in order to help other people can be an abundant outlet for our works.

However, before I can help other people, I need to *know* about other people first. Meaning, I need to expand my world, meet new people, talk to them, understand them, and perhaps help them with their struggles if I find myself sufficient to do so. In other words, I need to take the initiative to reach out so that my world can expand. And boy, do I hear a need to do networking as an introvert?

I also talked about this in my previous note. It is a reality for me that it is hard for me to take the initiative. Of course, the problem is likely to lie within myself. I believe I can do it if I try. But if you expect me to speak to that person who I want to talk to, and to say "Hey, what's up, bud? Hey, listen to what I've been building lately...", then I'm sorry, I won't be able to do that.

I need a strategy to connect to more people and share what I'm doing with life. A strategy for introverts like me. As stated previously, I couldn't and won't expect myself to be someone I'm not. I won't expect myself to turn 180 degrees and become a social butterfly who can crash into a group of people and say whatever the heck I want to say. Therefore, I need a different approach.

Before focusing too much on things I cannot do, let's focus on things that I can (or probably can) do to be more social and share my creative works:
- I can chat with other people online. Engaging in a conversation with said person and discuss a few things.
- I can write daily blog posts and share it to social media, without much expectation of it having any engagement from other people at all.
- When asked about what I do by someone, I can say that I am a web developer and provide example of projects that could help said person according to their situation in order to elaborate further on my work. Surprisingly, I can do it without much, if at all, anxiety or insecurity.

As you may have seen from the list above, I actually don't have problem with an act of conversing and exchanging ideas itself. The difference is that I'm really, like truly struggling with initiating a conversation. I'm struggling with the first "Hi, my name is Yosep" stage of conversation. Once I get through the first hurdle, I could say what I want to say, and listen what other people want to say.

On the bright side, I don't think I would have problems with initiating a conversation online. At the very least, I could open the profile page of the person I wish to engage with, write up a casual yet still polite introduction, and send it to that person. It would be great if I get a reply, but if I don't, I will try my best to not get disheartened.

I also have a Discord account where I join quite a few programming community servers. I could go and join the conversation there and see where I could offer my input to the problems which the people there are currently discussing.

Lastly, the blog posts. I used to write blog posts to record my work on daily basis. I would work (or study) from morning to afternoon, then at the end of the day, I would write a short blog post summarizing the day in casual manner. I would share my happy findings of the day, but I would also moan about the annoying features that I worked on that day. Basically, it was a share of unfiltered take of my daily life. This was a good habit that I once had, and I'm also trying to restart this habit once more when I finish building the new and updated version of my personal website with a blogging feature added on. 

Once I get this habit of blog-writing going, I can then start sharing it to social media without any expectation of it getting any sort of engagement in terms of likes, views, and whatnot. Because I don't really expect myself to be on trending as someone who share his writing to social media. I'm not so self-centered to expect that strangers on the Internet would spend their time to read my blog posts anyway. Therefore, I will share them because I simply want to share them. It would be as if I'm casting a net to the wilderness of the social media. If I can get one curious soul to DM me and ask about geeky stuff, then it means the world to me already, and I will be extremely grateful for that.

In short, my effort to write blog posts and share it to social media will not be an active effort to connect as in I would expect to get dozens of readers. But rather, it's my simply willingness and desire to let the world know what I'm doing with my life. As I work and study more every day, I would write more blog post, I would share it, then I over time, I would have a resume of blog post that I can share to other people whenever I need to explain what I'm doing with my life. It's as simple and straightforward as it gets.

As an introvert, especially for myself who do not think it's possible to engage with other people like extroverts do, my options to connect with others and expand my world will not be as many. However, it is far from insufficient. I have *enough* options so that I can engage in meaningful conversation to a handful of person at a time. Utilizing what I have found in this note, I'm confident that I can achieve my goal to engage with more people and expand my world.

I shall do all of these in order so that my creative works shall have meaning. And in order for me to reach those who may need my help and service in the Lord who has given me the talents to be creative.
