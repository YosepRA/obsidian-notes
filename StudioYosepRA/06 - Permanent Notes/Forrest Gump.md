This is the first time in my life to ever try to write a review of a movie. Or should I say, it's not a review, it's my raw feelings after I finish watching the movie. Unlike many previous entertainment media that I have watched and consumed, and even though I have a routine to go back to tonight. In the end, I choose to write about it. Not only because I want to write it, but more so because I am "nudged" to write it by God. For Forrest Gump has become one of the things that I want to bring to my grave.

It has been a long time, way too long for me to watch Forrest Gump. This movie was always lauded by the mass as one of the classics in all creative media. A masterpiece, even. And thus, I have had this desire to watch this movie for however long it has been. Finally today, for a reason that is as mundane as watching the paint dry because I needed to kill some time to update my game, I decided to watch Forrest Gump.

What I know of the movie is nothing better than what people say for it being a tearjerker. You know, something that you would get from some drama TV that is intended to make us cry. Although I am easily touched by tearjerker media, however... However... Forrest Gump is nothing like that at all.

Forrest Gump is a life story of a character with the same name, Forrest Gump. As he say every time he meets new people, "Hi, I'm Forrest Gump", as he says it with a face full of innocent and honest smile.

Forrest Gump is, for a lack of better words and understanding due to my ignorance, a mentally challenged person. He has an IQ of 75 that makes him seen as a stupid person by the society standard. With his conditions such as that, it is a given that he is receiving a "special" treatment, some of them are good, and most of them are bad. 

However, Forrest Gump is a story that is so far from a pity-party story to make us sympathize to those who are mentally challenged. In fact, despite his conditions, he lives his life with a positive outlook. Even when he is not given any seat in his first ride in school bus, even when he is bullied, he chooses to let it past and not to overthink about it (at least that is how I see it).

Forrest Gump is a story about Forrest from little to adult. To be honest, I don't know where to start. I might as well write the whole story once again in this very note, and I don't know whether I could finish it in a matter of minutes, or even perhaps days. So, I want this note to become an ongoing project that I would write every day until the ink runs dry. Because my feelings about this movie, what I thought as I say every moment in it, are not as simple as writing a short note. For this movie has become one of my precious thing in my life. That I'm grateful to have watched this movie.

Let's start with his childhood. Forrest grew up alone with his mother. Ever since childhood, he suffered from a condition that makes him unable to walk properly. Therefore, the movie started with a story of Forrest and his mother visiting the doctor to put a brace to his legs to make him able to walk, albeit limply still.

Forrest's mother (Mrs. Gump) is a single mother. I don't recall the state of his father being said other than Mrs. Gump saying that he went to vacation. Although, it's clearly implied that the father has abandoned Mrs. Gump and Forrest. Mrs. Gump raised Forrest with love and caring like a true mother. She accepts that Forrest has a special condition. However, she refuses to acknowledge that even with Forrest's condition, it doesn't make her son any less human or any less normal than any of his peers. Quoting from herself saying to Forrest:

"Don't let anybody tell you they are better than you, Forrest. If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs."

*- Mrs. Gump talking to Forrest about his braced legs specifically, and perhaps his conditions as a whole.*

Then comes school years and Forrest is about to register to a public school. However, because of his condition and having an IQ of 75, he is having a hard time to be accepted in a local public school. Mrs. Gump visited the principal office, and they had a discussion about Forrest's school registration matter. The principal insisted that Forrest's IQ is too low to be accepted in his school, but Mrs. Gump insisted that her son should get the same opportunity as others. The negotiation came to a deadlock and Mrs. Gump said to the principal, "Is there really nothing that can be done?" To which the principal replied, "Where is Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?" Mrs. Gump then replied, "He went to a vacation." 

Shortly after, the movie is fast forwarded to a scene where the principal and Mrs. Gump sleep together to "sort out" Forrest's school registration, a scene which I still think as quite disturbing. It's disturbing because a man could become a ravenous wolf to prey on the weak. And on the other side, Mrs. Gump's love for Forrest is much stronger than her supposed humiliation to please the principal on the bed. In order to get her son to the "normal" school, she is willing to do as far as that.
