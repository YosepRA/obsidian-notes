I'm a 26 years old man by the year of 2024. I'm living through life with only a handful of accomplishment that I can take pride of. I'm a busy man. Yes, I'm too busy worrying about every little thing in life that it makes life dreadful. There is little thing that I can be grateful of, but the things that I can't be grateful of were all my own doing, I won't blame anyone but myself for it. So despite my apparent depression, I'm still holding on to my life, and I can feel my desire to keep on living deep down in my heart. Therefore, in that case, I'm totally fine.

I'm at a time when I understand how wasteful my life has been. I know that I should've done more, and I fully understand and realize that I'm allowed to run amok and live a wholehearted life full of desire to grow and live until the day I die. I too understand that God has given me His blessings to do so. Really, I'm allowed to wish or do anything, because my Lord and I know that my wishes are good and sincere. And yet despite that, I can't bring my butt to do what I clearly want to do, and have the blessings to do.

As the amount of things that I want to do and learn grow day by day, I understand how short life is. There are so much things to do, and too little time to do it all. I understand that too, and yet again, I can't bring myself to do what I want to do.

Perhaps, let's start with a simple question, since you wish to do so much more, what do you want once you accomplish so much more things compared to how you are now? Is it glory? Fame? Or to prove anybody wrong? No, I wish for none of that. I don't wish to reach the sun, nor do I wish to be eternally remembered as one of the greatest person ever lived. Although indeed that I've lived a life full of ridicule from my family and friends exactly because of my unproductive life. But well, who doesn't experience that kind of ridicules anyway? 

Although it's very much the reality that I haven't done enough in my life, I try to not make this about others who make fun of me, but rather a simple cause-and-effect because of what I do. People can say whatever they like, and I have the right and power to let it bore into my heart or not. And I choose not to entertain my heart's ache beyond listening to it and tell it to keep on going. Or at least, that's what I've been trying to do.

It's true that I'm trying to not make this about me proving others wrong for their jeers. But at the same time, I admit that I can feel the weight of others' ridicules and expectations on me. Many people were calling me a useless piece of freeloader. Enough of them to say the same thing over time, then I couldn't help but think about it. It's the reality, I understand it, admit it, and I won't deny it. However, as I try to be more useful, both to myself and others around me, and then when I fail at something, I couldn't help but murmur in my own heart, "Ah... I'm a useless person after all for failing at such a simple thing."

It's a vicious cycle of thoughts as I try to keep on going with life, and whenever I find an obstacle that make me stumble and feel miserable for myself, I can't help but thinking that my effort to keep on living can only lead to the same feeling of uselessness. As this cycle continue to repeat over and over again, it's somewhat inevitable that my heart and mind would succumb in nihilism, of the futility of everything. That in the end, no matter what I do, they're either not mattered or I go back to become a person worth of ridiculing.

I know my decision to not run from reality is the right one. I know that it's not wise to live apathetically and totally ignore what others say about you. Yes, people can say and do whatever they want. However again, I have the right and power to let it bore into my heart or not. Therefore, in that case, I have chosen to *let* what other people say bore into my heart. In the end, I'm still not wise enough to differentiate between acknowledging what people say, and letting what people say bore into my heart. 

Therefore, I believe it's okay for me to simply admit what people say as simply things they say, and admit that some of them may be true, yet few of them can also be nonsense. But in the end of it, I need to understand that what matters is for me to, again, remind my heart and encourage it to keep on going. 

Simply keep on going. Because again, life is too short and I have many, many things that I want to do, projects to work on, things to share, people to meet, places to go, and skills to learn about. What's present in front of me is a simple choice, for me to let what people say become the weight of approval on my heart. Or I can let my heart live its whole life, to follow its unyielding and sincere desire to express its love for life.

For life is too short to not do things that you like. Might as well let this joyful heart run amok and follow it wherever it goes.
