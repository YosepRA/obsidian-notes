An ability to multitask is seen as an invaluable skill to have in today's economy. To be able to juggle between multiple tasks at the same time, while also appear to be able to deliver results well enough is seen as a superhero in action. The peak of productivity, some people said. If one cannot multitask, one cannot hope to survive in this rapidly moving world of information.

Mankind continues to push to do more works with less time spent. If yesterday you can finish two works in one hour, today you should strive to do three. With that in mind, multitask is seen to be an important skill to have. So important that it becomes one of the most important sign of judging productivity rate of a person.

I've always struggled with an idea of working on different tasks at the same time. For one, it has always been a lot easier for me to focus on one task at hand than to split it to different ones. On other hand, it's my growing loathe of an idea from people who think multitasking is cool while also their flaunting for shallow works that they don't put enough thoughts in. It's of my utmost satisfaction to see people who flaunt their multitask productivity stumbled when asked in depth about the works they've done.

This is not a question for quality vs. quantity. What multitasker are trying to achieve is to finish as much work as they can in a short span of time by jumping between these different tasks. When they are able to finish an X amount of works in one hour, they see it as a win. A matter of the weight and quality of their works is yet another question to ask.

In regards to quality vs. quantity, contrasting to how the world perceive it, it's more valuable for creative people to produce more instead of focusing on one piece for a long time. I understand that this point is contradictory to what I've been saying in this essay, but hear me out.

I'm drawing an experiment written in a book *Art and Fear* by David Bayles and Ted Orland. It's an experiment of sculptor students. One group is given a task to build only one sculpture, and put their focus on creating that one quality sculpture. While the other group is given a task to build as many sculpture as they can. Then after one day, the professor will give valuation to their works. Surprisingly enough, the ones that gets an A are the ones from the group that focuses on quantity rather than quality.

It happens because the quality group is putting too much focus on pondering the question on how to create "the perfect sculpture". Therefore, they are stuck in planning stage as they worry that their idea is not good enough to be called perfect. While the quantity group is spending their time with actually getting their hands dirty and experiment with their idea by building more and more sculptures. As they build more sculpture, they learn more about their prior mistakes, and apply improvements in their next works. Since they don't need to think as much about the quality, they can just throw themselves in the fun of experiments.

The essence of this experiment is that it's not wise to spend our time pondering on how to create the perfect creation because quality will inevitably come when one is open to possible mistakes and failures in their attempts to create.

Now, what this experiment has to do with multitasking? When people are judging about the rate of productivity, they are judging about the amount of work done in a certain amount of time, and the ability to jump between different tasks while maintaining their focus and deliver results. The problem itself is not the amount of work that is being done, but the jumping between different task is. It's a lie for one to be able to jump back and forth between different task, and they are able to maintain their focus and quality of their works. Because it's more likely for one to stumble and overwhelmed by the amount of tasks that they have to juggle at the same time. Not only will it result in a poor performance, but also overdue stresses over time. It's a lie that one can maintain their sanity while juggling between different tasks every day, every time.

There perhaps a bit more biases in this post than usual. But this is a point where I'm willing to stand my ground. A point where multitask is a baseless criteria to determine how productive and how much quality one can offer. And a point that an ability to put more focus on each tasks one at a time and perform consistent deep work should be a more sought after skill to have in this information overloaded world. Not only to produce much better quality in one's work, but also maintain a healthy work environment for those who are willing to go deep.
