Whenever I finish exercising, especially after a long time since I did, I would feel muscle soreness at night. It's not an excruciating pain, but it's enough to distract me from my sleep. Strangely enough, I didn't feel sore last night. Yes, I cannot fold my legs because it feels uncomfortable, and I need to keep my legs straight almost all the time, but there is no pain.

It is said that when we exercise, the muscle will get torn in order for it to grow. The torn muscle will cause an obvious pain that perhaps could hinder us in our daily life. However, this process is necessary so that our muscle can grow in strength. Because once the torn muscle is healed, it will grow a new set of muscle, leaving it with a thicker mass.

I know nothing about human physiology because I haven't done enough research on it, but it does feel that my muscle that I developed back then when I did my daily run is still here in my legs. Meaning, when I do run again like yesterday, I would experience less muscle tear compared to my first time. And I found it quite exciting indeed.

My goal to exercise is not to gain something frivolous from it. I exercise because that's what human body must do. As an experienced shut-in, there is no worse feeling that having an inactive body. I can hear my body creaking and my muscle losing its weight whenever I spend my days sitting in front of my desk. I have accepted that being a software developer is to accept the reality that it is a desk job. However, this is not to say that I cannot exercise and keep my body active.

I read once in an article (or a book) that human is one of the best runner among all species. It's probably not in terms of speed, but more like in terms of endurance. Human body is made to run a long distance. Again, I couldn't elaborate more on this point scientifically, but I think that makes sense. In our hunter and gatherer age, men are walking and running all day long to hunt or to run away from something. That can only be achieved through human's body sheer endurance to constantly run. For men on that age, it's pretty much a given that they strengthen their human core through daily activities. However, this is not the case for today's age where we slow down a lot in our need to run.

That is why it's important to keep this one trait of our kin alive. I want to exercise every day so that I can gain a bit of that endurance that we once had as a species. I want to be able to run a long distance so that I won't feel exhausted enough to make me fall down. I want to be able to run, so that I only need a brief time of rest before I can run again. So yeah, that is my fitness goal. This won't be easy, for sure. But all I need to do is to choose and to start.
