"Self-efficacy is not the conviction that we can never make an error. It is the conviction that we are able to think, to judge, to know-and to correct our errors. It is trust in our mental processes and abilities."

Branden, Nathaniel.Â _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_. Bantam, 1994.

Whenever I face a life challenge, I would often just freeze on the spot, not knowing what to do. I know that I should face it and not run away, but I also fear the possibility of failure that may come. The only way for me to survive this situation is to succeed. But even then, I couldn't really guarantee myself to achieve it from the start. In the end, I would often end up just standing still and not choosing whether to move forward or backward.

Of course, the root of this problem is my fear of failure. I've thought about many things in regards of this fear in particular, and I'm still learning it even to this day. Failure is rooted deeply in results, and results alone. There is no two other ways about it. This primal instinct that if I fail, I will die is rooted within me. I understand that this amount of fear is excessive. That's why I keep on digging on this topic in order to improve on my answer up to this point.

Failure is rooted in results, and there is a way to lessen its importance so that we can move on with life. See, the more I think about it, life can only happen if we move forward. And in order for us to move forward, we need to face the challenges ahead of us. When facing the challenges ahead of us, it is nothing but a requirement to embrace the absolute probability of failure along the way. 

There is no compromise on this land to the point that failure is near inevitable when we choose to step forward, and that is okay. Because what we get from a journey is not only failure; there is also successes, sorrows, joy, and regret. But that's just life, isn't it? And life can only happen if we choose to face our challenges and move forward.

That's why I believe, I want to believe and plant it in my mind, that the courage to face life's challenges is so much more important than what we may get from it. I would even dare to say that the results don't matter at all. I always have good intentions in my heart in every steps in my life. And even if I'm a sinful human being, God knows that I have good intentions in my heart so that my life be fruitful. 

Even to this day, I'm still learning what it means to leave things in the hands of God. Which means, to leave *the results* of my good works solely in His hands. I could project the result that I want to achieve, but ultimately, God decides what the results may be. I'm not saying that I'm not responsible with the outcome of my works. I know that as long as I hold good intentions in my works, then the results **will never** be malice in the eyes of God. And I can rest easy and face the difficulties of life with earnest heart.

This is why it is totally okay for me to not be perfect. To not be able to do all things perfectly and to not know everything there is to know. If there is something I don't know, then learn! If there is something I need help with, then ask for help! There is virtue in admitting your ignorance, and a willingness to learn that is much more precious than any gold in this world. And I can see that God sees this as good as well.

Therefore, be courageous in the face of life challenges. For what matters is not the results, but the courage to take the first step, and the persistence to keep on walking. Just walk with a holy heart, and leave whatever you may encounter along the way to God.
