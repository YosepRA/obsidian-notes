## Studying, for the Love of It, and Not for Money

This is my second day of using Obsidian as my note-taking tool, or to be more precise, it's my new thought recorder. Previously, I have been using plain Word files and organize it as best as I can using folders. But I was finding it difficult to navigate through these documents in order for me to recall what I've written in the past. Thus, I searched for a new way and I found about writing mini-essays and a software called *Obsidian* from [*Odysseas*](https://www.youtube.com/@odysseas__w) YouTube channel. And I found it to be a great addition to my routine since writing was never a chore to me.

As I slowly integrate Obsidian in my study today, I found that my study has been more fun than before. I've been having a problem where I can't retain information from the many books that I read every day. I find it frustrating to not be able to recall enough of information that I can't explain it to myself, let alone to other people. I needed a better way to study, and so I found about mini-essays and Obsidian as previously mentioned.

Previously, when I read a book, I would settle with writing pointers of ideas that I found interesting from the book. I thought that will be enough for me to revisit later, and perhaps reflect upon it. But alas, I never did any of that. I never felt that my study is as fruitful as I hope it would be.

Once I would go with speed reading, thinking that adding volumes will add wealth to my mind's library. But I've never been a fan of it. I don't find an ability to read tens of books per week as interesting and appealing as other people. I believe the more important thing is whether one can recall (and explain) the content of the books which they are reading. Even better if one is able to explain it in a way that other people can understand it easily. It's Feynman technique. Everybody knows that, but rarely apply it in their life, including myself.

Now with mini-essays and Obsidian, I think I have a great mix of routine that is not time consuming enough to make me feel daunted, and so much more fun because I can see the connections between what I've written in the past. The library is pretty much empty right now, but I will surely build it over time.

That's enough of a preface as it's easy for me to speak in tangents. Let's get to the main topic. With mini-essays and Obsidian, I found that studying has been more fun that it used to. And I realize, or being reminded of how much I love studying. I've always loved the sensation of learning new knowledge. I've always loved the feeling when I can apply it to a real world problems. And perhaps, I've always loved it when I share it with others too. But sadly, I have forgotten these feelings for a long while now. Because I'm now an adult, and I need not only to take care of myself, but also my family. Therefore, every actions that I take, I feel a need to think of a way to *make money out of it.*

It's very ironic for me who claims the romance of "living not for money." Because in the end, I'm also worried that I won't have enough to put bread on the table. Sure, it's something that I need to work on since I'm a believer, a follower of Christ. But that besides the point. With this mindset, I inevitable think that somehow, my studies *must* yield some monetary value. And I have to say, it hasn't been a healthy mindset to have in my life.

Whenever I get curious of something and wanted to learn it, there is always that question of whether I can make a living out of these materials which I'm curious about. Sometimes, I stopped and heed the question. Oftentimes, it leads me to great despair. If I think I can't use it to make a living, then why bother? It's a deadly spiral as my thoughts always short-circuit itself whenever I connect my desire to learn and thinking of a way to make a living out of it. Again, this is something that I need to work on.

With mini-essays and Obsidian, I felt a sense of purpose in my studies. I love it when I can see visually that my knowledge is growing. That I record my thoughts in a place where I can revisit them with much ease. That I believe these bits of knowledge *will* be useful for my future self whenever he needs a refresher or just try to look back at the steps that he made. For once, yes, for once... I don't think that the reason for my studies is for money, and money alone.

I love studying. I love expanding the ideas that I found in a book in my own words. I love watching my library of essays grows as I live. I love the feeling that I have a bit more knowledge than I was yesterday. I love that I'm fully aware that I'm growing today. That way, I know that I've moved forward in life. That my effort from yesterday isn't futile. I want to thank Odyyseas again for the timely videos and guidance. And I want to thank God for leading me in this revelation.

Yes, I'm ready. I'm ready to learn more and more about many things in life. As I will record it, for the joy of my heart.
