We have our own set of values that we hold highly in life. This set of values and principles are what rooted us to what we see as good and bad, noble and vile. Through this set of values and principles, we find our true voice that resounds in our hearts if we let them. And if we follow this voice, we would get into a place, a journey, where we can truly say that life is worth it.

However, it is not rare for anyone to not have principles in their life. It's either they haven't found one, or they are unsure in what they see as precious. Either way, it results in a behavior where one does not respect their own voice. When they want to do something, they would get discouraged and say "what's the point?" And if they manage to push through that one wall, the next time they get criticized, they would stumble and give up.

When we see others' voice as more precious than our own, it's very likely that we will never experience a fulfilling life. Because all we do is follow every voice but our own.

This is not a call to be narcissistic or self-centered where we *only* listen to our own voice and that others' voice doesn't matter, but it's a call to listen to our own voice *more* than what other people say. It is certain that we can receive good advices from other people, but it isn't rare for others to also say nonsensical things that causes us unnecessary doubts in our heart. Although on the other hand, sure, we are not inerrant and what we say are never wrong. But we also know that little voice that comes from our deepest of hearts, the voice that we fear to listen to, the voice that tells us to do good, and the voice that pushes us to become a better person. That little voice is the one that we *must* listen at all times.

What we hold as valuable and priceless in life, especially those that are good and honorable, comes from this little heart of ours. This voice is often crowded by the worry of the world and the dispute that comes from what other people say to or about us. However, whenever we so choose to open our ear to this voice, it will give us wisdom to carry on to life to a direction where your life becomes an honorable life which you can be grateful and proud of. And finally, from this little heart of ours shall rise a resounding set of principles which rooted us to who we truly are, and what we see as truly priceless in our life.

What I see as precious in life, and what I hold highly are these:

1. Jesus Christ is my Lord and Master. For ever and ever, I will bow down and kneel to Him and He only.
2. Learning and doing things the hard way is the only way to make life worth it.

The first point is a given. There is no need for me to elaborate more than it already is. However, I do need to elaborate more about the second one because it summarizes many different things that are priceless to me, but they are seen as foolish or even na√Øve to many other people.

See, I love doing things the hard way. When I was at school and I was learning a difficult topic such as math, I would be willing to spend a lot more time in not only solving the problem, but also ask further question as to why a certain calculation is used to solve this problem. I've always had this sort of patience to face difficult problems, a trait which I haven't used enough in my adult years. However, this trait is still here, close to my heart.

The reason why I want to talk about this is because what I see as priceless goes against what the world sees as priceless. This is a world of speed where everything is determined by how quick one can do task(s) at any given time. We are always in a rush of anything because we fear that we won't get a share of the cake if we go any slower. And this tendency to do everything quickly results in a culture where everyone tends to seek the shortcut of everything.

That's why we often see tutorials in YouTube titled "Master skill (x) only in (y) hours" or some other similar yet silly titles. I once saw a video tutorial titled "Become a JavaScript master in 1 hour." I saw that and went "yeah, try it if you can." It is nonsense, it is laughable. How can you master a programming language in only a certain amount of hours? Sure you can watch the video and practice it, but what can you build with that one hour of mastering a topic? You may get a false sense of achievement because now you feel like you are ready to build something, only before you realize how short you have become.

I'm not here to demean anyone who does things in a fast and hurried way. It's just I can never agree to this notion that the best way is to do it quickly in all we do in life. Have you guys ever experience the sense of fulfilling achievements where you commit yourself to do hard things, you push through many different challenges with sheer patience and honest effort, and then you manage to successfully build something out of it? Whenever I push through to learn something difficult and apply what I learn to solve a real problem, I would get this jumpy feeling in my heart where it leaps with joy at this achievement. This kind of joy is truly precious to me. So far that I would trade my whole life only for a handful of these joyful experiences.

We have come to a culture where people are looking for shortcuts in all they do. In that shortcut path, people are crowded with each other there fighting for a grain of sands. It's pitiful to see because they don't see the other path. This path may not be quicker than the shortcut, but this path leads you to lakes and rivers, mountains and valleys. Although these two paths lead to the same direction, what we encounter along the journey is vastly different.

That's why I won't take shortcuts in life. If I want to be good at something, I would put my heads down and work my butt for it. I want to embrace the journey where I visit these uncharted places, I want to experience all of the joys and sorrows along the way, and by the end of it, I will show to the people who have taken the shortcut the delightful fruits that I found from the long and arduous path.

Doing hard things is what makes life worth it. A long hard day of work leads to a good sleep. A long hard life journey leads to a good rest of life before I reach where the Lord is. Although I may not be able to experience all things that I wish to do, but in all things that I manage to do, I want fully live it.
