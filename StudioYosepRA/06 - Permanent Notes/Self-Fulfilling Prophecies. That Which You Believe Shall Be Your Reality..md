What you think, believe, and have conviction on is your reality. No matter what it is, if you genuinely believe it as a fact in your life, then it shall become your reality.

When you think low of yourself, you see yourself as someone incapable and insufficient in life, then it's only time to tell before you become crippled in life and unable to do anything. Because your beliefs have become true. You think you are right because you truly become incapable of life is a proof that your prior conviction is the right one. You would say to yourself, "Ah, I always knew it," while the fact is that your actions *reinforce* your beliefs.

What you think, believe, and have conviction on shall become a self-fulfilling prophecies. Once you genuinely believe your convictions, it's only a matter of time before you start living your daily life according to said convictions. I mean, how can you believe that you can do fruitful works if you believe yourself to be a fraud? How can you do good works when you have a repeating sentences in your head that says "You are not good enough"? 

As much as you want to try, you can't go against your mind. You can deviate from it to a certain extent. However, it is only a matter of time before your unconscious body will adjust its course according to what you see as "right." That is your beliefs and convictions about yourself.

There is no smoke without fire. There is no effect without a cause. There is no way a good tree produces bad fruits. And otherwise, there is no way a bad tree produces good fruits.

I'm not saying that all you need is a little pep-talk against the mirror saying "you are good enough" or "you will be whatever you wish to be." Those are just meaningless sweet talks that you won't believe anyway. However, it's more likely, nay, it's inevitable for people who hold out hope in life to live a fruitful life than those whose hearts were filled with despair.

This is also to say that convictions should be tested by doing the opposite. If you believe that you are not good enough to face life's challenges. Then challenge it by facing one challenge in your life today. Though there isn't a guarantee that it will all work out flawlessly and easily. There is a guarantee that you will learn something good from it. The more you challenge your twisted beliefs, the more you shall realize how much of a nonsense it is. And before you know it, you will abandon your twisted beliefs for a good life which you deserve to have.

Therefore, challenge your beliefs. If you think you are not good enough to face life, then face one challenge today. If you think you can't do hard things, then do one hard task today. If you think your works aren't good enough, then try building something anyway. You actions and challenges towards your beliefs shall become self-fulfilling prophecies which work in your favor. And finally, your beliefs and convictions that you are good enough for life shall be your reality.
