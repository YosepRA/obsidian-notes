I've lived for 26 years. That's quite a long time to live. Despite everything, I do encounter a few bits of wisdom along the way. Things that are no further than the truth, or at least part of the whole truth of the world. One of them is that life is full of surprises.

It's a well-known fact that things rarely go as planned. We may need more time on a project, or perhaps we overspend on budget that we thought to be enough previously, or perhaps you didn't manage to enter the school that you've dreamt of since you were little.

It's indeed very rare for goals to go according to our plan, no matter how prepared and how committed we are to take necessary action to achieve said goals. But is it an excuse to not set goals in life? Certainly not. I, for example. have tried to not integrate any goals in life and live spontaneously. It only lead me to a live with no direction as I spend listlessly throughout the day. Inaction is indeed worse than failure. And it's the result of a life without a certain goal in mind.

However, I also understand how disappointing it is to not be able to achieve our goal despite our sincere effort. Does it make our effort futile because we don't manage to achieve our goals? Again, it's not true. Our effort spent to pursue one goal may lead to yet another encounter in life. Say one may fail to publish a fiction book. Perhaps those writing skills that one has polished before may be useful in your next endeavor, such as screenwriting.

Sure, it's heartbreaking to see our effort unrewarded. But it's not an excuse to live without goals, or be afraid to pursue one despite prior failures. So, how should we approach this? The answer for that is for us to welcome the surprises of life, and be encouraged because of it.

The surprises, or detours of life are often the fun one to pursue. Taken to heart, these endeavors may bring fruits that we would never thought of before. This understanding brought me to my attempt to live without goal. But as I've said before, it didn't yield anything as I lived my life listlessly.

Therefore, it's important for us to set goals in life, but at the same time welcome the detours we may encounter along the way. Our goal will set our sight to a certain direction far ahead. At the very least, it will serve as our guiding light so that we know that we are moving forward toward a clear enough place ahead.

However, as we all know, we can't see past today. Therefore, the road from tomorrow ahead is filled with uncertainties and darkness. Tomorrow may be a smooth sailing just like today, or perhaps we may encounter a storm that forces us to tread carefully. Or maybe there are rocky island up ahead and we have to switch our heading from how we initially thought.

These obstacles are the detours of life. It's easy to be discouraged because things don't go as planned. But it's the height of wisdom to be encouraged instead and keep your heart steady and hopeful because God is leading you somewhere He wanted you to go. At least, that's how I see it, and that's how I continue to *learn* to see it.

I may not be wise enough to cheer up and be hopeful because I'm not in a good place right now. But I want to continue to learn to see all of these as the detours of life where God is trying to teach me something I may not be aware of. The least I can do is to remain hopeful and put my faith in Him. Of course, I will keep on adjusting my goals and spend my daily life with as much good works I can afford that day. As a matter of fact, I'm writing this at evening, which is a rare thing for me to do for so long now. I used to have a habit to study at night, and this is my attempt to reignite this habit once more. Because I simply don't have enough time in life.

Well, I went to my own detours of thoughts there. Haha... It's often hard to stop this thoughts from trailing. Sometimes, I should control it. But oftentimes, I think it's fine to let it run amok. Yes, it's still important for us to set goals in life. But only use it merely as the first yardstick for our initial direction. As we walk through this road, we should welcome the pleasant surprises that may show itself. With courageous heart and excitement shall we tread this water. For the sweetest fruit may only be reap while we are off the course.
