We are what we truly believe and have convictions on. If we genuinely believe that it's possible for us to do something, it's inevitable that we will do actions according to what we hold close to our heart. On the other hand, if we truly believe that something is not true, then it is near impossible for us to do any productive action going against said belief because we "know" that it isn't true.

Self-fulfilling prophecies. That which you believe shall be your reality. This goes both ways, good and bad. If you believe that you can't climb that tree, then it's less likely for you to try and climb it. On the other hand, if you believe climbing that tree is possible, then you will start grabbing the tree's trunk to get a grip on it in no time.

However, it is not to say that whatever you wish or believe shall always be true. Because first of all, you have to genuinely believe and have enough faith that you are capable to achieve it. I mean, how can you imagine yourself being the richest person on earth tomorrow unless you win one heck of a lottery? There is no way you can achieve that just because you say so in front of a mirror.

We can only believe what is possible and appropriate for us. There is a fine line between aiming for the sky and having realistic dreams. Yes, it's great to have a strong desire to live and aim high. Because then, it is more likely for you to reach a higher place when you aim high than low. However, what people see as high or low of a goal is subjective to each person. For one businesswoman, she may have a dream to become so rich that they enter the Forbes magazine. For one artist, he may wish for one of his work to become one of the classics of this decade. For one writer, she may wish to publish 10 books. And for yet another person, he may wish to have enough to feed his family. 

As long as one sees their goal as possible and appropriate, then it's a half-work done. The rest depends on their honest works and effort. I, for example, believe that being a good software engineer isn't outside of my reach. I never had the privilege to attend computer science college. However, I truly believe that I can reach a satisfying height for myself when it comes to mastering software engineering and computer science. 

I don't think I'm trapped in the hole of Dunning-Kruger effect either, because I truly understand how vast the world of software engineering is. So vast that I won't have enough time and energy to study and understand it all in my short life span.

My halted progress at this moment however is the result of my indecision and fear about life in general than my convictions about my abilities to pursuit this journey. Therefore. I pray that I could come in peace with myself and restart this journey with an earnest and clear heart. 

But in the end, I honestly see this goal of mine as both possible and appropriate for me. There is no doubt for me that I will reach a certain height that is satisfying enough for me. I can see the path ahead of me, and all I need to do is take the leap of faith and trek this journey.
