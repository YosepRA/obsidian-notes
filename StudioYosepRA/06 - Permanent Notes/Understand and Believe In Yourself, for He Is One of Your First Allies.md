We are influenced by those around us. It can be what your neighbor say about your family, a stranger's opinion on one particular drama online, or that one particular ad about a video game from a popular series. There is so much input from this world. Too much even for us to digest it all wisely. Sadly, this also means that what we think about ourselves and the world were also influenced by those around us.

After living long enough, we have understood a few common rules when it comes to living in a society. Work hard, strive for the best, aim for the sky, pursue your dreams. *Et cetera, et cetera.* I'm not saying they are wrong, but it doesn't mean that it tells a whole truth either. I found it unwise to follow what most people say, apply it to your life, then measure the quality of your life based on those values. However, quality of one's own life is far from what is determined by any external factors.

In a field of sports, where everyone is living to their edge to become the number one. Even in this environment, there are athletes who are successful because of their hard work, there are those who are *not* successful despite their hard work. On the other hand, there are also athletes who are rather successful while treating their sports as your regular job. Because perhaps, for this one particular athletes, what matters to him is his family back home and their simple farm life. Even when he reaches the peak of his sporting career, all he can say is "It's good. The job is done, now we can go home."

I'm not saying that these are unserious athletes who got lucky because they win something. You can't reach a certain height in life without enough dedication and hard work. However, for this one athlete, perhaps what drives him to train and play the game isn't solely his love for the game, but rather his family back home. With his less caring attitude of the game, he may have played with so much less pressure than those who worked hard and dedicate their life to their game. When we have less pressure to ourselves, it's more likely for us to take risks and explore what is possible in our craft.

Different people have their own set of values, of what they see as good and noble. One person may see their career is their everything, yet another may see the time spend reading novels at night to be the peak experience of her life. To see and understand what is valuable and noble to ourselves, I think, is one, if not, the most important turning point in one's life. When we understand what makes us feel at peace, a certain factor, habit, or work that doesn't go against our own individuality, then at that point, we feel the most peace with ourselves. And we all know, nothing will ever come good when we go against our own heart. On the other hand, we are able to see the beauty of this world once we are peaceful with ourselves.

To understand ourselves requires us to be conscious, of our thoughts and feelings. If what comes out of your heart is good, which is most of the time, then listen to it and do it. For me, I feel so much pressure when I have to think about the way to make money using my web development skills. The pressure is too much that it cripples me from living my life. I, unfortunately, don't love software engineering enough to imagine myself to be successful at it. However, I do love this craft enough to dedicate my whole life to it. Other than that, I wish for a life where I can read so much stories and play so much more video games. Enough so that the amount of books that I read can fill up the once library of Alexandria.

In short, it will be good if I can earn enough from my skills so that I can not only feed myself, but also give me a life where I can read, learn, and play to my heart's content. After all of the pondering, this is what I found deep inside my heart and what matters to me the most in my life on earth.
