I'm living my daily life often in this state of limbo. The feeling that I know that I must get the work done, but also the uncertainties of where I would go. I would work for some days, then I would be slothful in the others. When I don't put in some work, I would be guilty of wasting yet another day. However, even when I put in some work, I would question whether I have done enough or whether I am certain if I'm going to the right direction.

As I write this post, I still don't have a job, nor a prospect. There are things that I want to do, but I'm afraid that I don't have the capital to even walk far enough distance. My days are spent with sheer frustration and anger of how things go. Whether I work or not, I often don't feel good. To be honest, I was on the brink of venting my rage in this post by swearing and all. But I refrain from doing so because, well, it's unhealthy *and* useless thing to do.

At some point, I prayed time and again for God's help. I won't say that He hasn't helped me as I'm still alive and well today, and He has provided for me what I need to not only live, but also work. However, as much as I don't want to be ungrateful, but I often feel that I haven't received enough help. 

I still can't see where I'm going, or any sort of hope that I can look forward to. I can only see how bleak my tomorrow could be, that tomorrow too I would spend in this limbo.

What can I do then? Honestly and simply put, all I can do is to keep on walking. Though I can't see what is far ahead, but at the very least, I can still see one or two steps ahead. I don't know whether this road will take me to a dark valley or a sunny mountaintop. All I can do is to keep on walking.

My hope lies solely in Christ whom I put my life on. And to keep on walking is my proof that I'm still holding that fire. I can understand that God is teaching me and giving me a dose of uncertainties in my life. I need to stay strong and persist through it all.

Thus I say, I will keep on waiting. Waiting for my Lord. However, I shall keep on walking. This is the active stillness. I will not hold any hope of what I may see further ahead. I will lay my hope in Christ alone. And every little step I take will become my proof that I still hold that hope. A hope that God will get me out of this despairing hole.
