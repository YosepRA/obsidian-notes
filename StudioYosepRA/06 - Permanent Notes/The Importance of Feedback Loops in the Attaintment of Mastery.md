Mastery, one's comprehensive knowledge or skill in a subject or accomplishment, doesn't come from what you learn from school. Mastery can only be attained through experience, forged through the successes and failures when facing real world problems. A process of continuous refining when we learn what works and what isn't in our attempt to solve problems. The experience that will never come if one stay with their books and never practice it in real life.

It's admittedly weird whenever we see masters at work in whatever field, from field works, business, to art. From our beginner's eyes, what comes out of the masters' hands are easily flowing out of it. As if it comes rather easily compared to how we usually do it.

It's easy for us beginners to worship the way masters work in their crafts. But of course, there are more than meets the eye. What we see is not an omniscient being, but rather a sharp sword, forged through the successes and failures they have experienced. They know what they should do, and likewise they know what they should avoid. If we ask them to explain their working process in detail, it's likely that they cannot explain it in a way we expected, which is a step-by-step guide we often read in many self-help books out there. It's not even rare for these masters to say that they do it because it's what their *gut* is telling them to do. But gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience (Ahrens, 2017).

The question now is how do we attain experience in our field of knowledge? It's easy to say that in order to get more experience, one has to get a job in said field. To a great extent, this is true. Because in a job, you can encounter many situations and problems that you can't learn from a small sandbox that is schools. But experience that is necessary in our path to mastery doesn't only come from our job, but also how we study.

What makes experience valuable isn't about how many years you have spent in a particular field, but rather how many problems you have encountered and the way you faced them. When we encounter a problem, we learn what to do and what not to do. Most of the time, we would try something to solve the problem, but alas we stumbled on our failure, even sometimes miserably even. But only from that kind of experience do we know not to do the same mistake, as we tell our brain and body as such and try to not offer exactly the same solution if we encounter the same problem in the future.

This cycle of encountering problems, experimenting on solutions, succeeding or failing, then finally learn from it is called feedback loops. The more failures you have will lead you to the correct answer. And the more correct answer you have learned from your mistake, the more comprehensive and complex your knowledge will become because your knowledge is no longer bound to what is taught by your teacher or what is written from the books. Because you have taken the adventure of facing many problems and giving your answers. Enough of this experience, then you will trust your gut more than what is taught to be "correct" when you were in school.'

Of course, this doesn't mean that at this stage, we no longer need to open any more books, or attend any more lectures. One must continue to learn as long as one lives. Becoming good at something doesn't make you omniscient. On the contrary, as those who have walked long enough in life, the more you know about something, the more question you will have. Those questions will then become a desire to learn more and to attain more knowledge. We would read more books, we would attend more lectures, and we would discuss it more with our peers. And finally, we would apply it to our practice against real life problems, experiment on it, giving our answers, and learn from whatever successes and failures that we may get.

It has been forever since I longed for a system where I can get a similar effect of feedback loops with that of having a job. Well, in my case, it's not everyday I can face real world problems and test what I know. If only there were a studying system that enables us to have consistent feedback loops on our works. Writing mini-essays like what I'm doing right now has been providing me with the much needed system, at least for my writing and studying. At this moment in time as I read *How to Take Smart Notes,* I'm trying to deconstruct its components so that I can apply it to many other things, such as software development and art.

For now, this will do. I will come back to this note, or write another one to elaborate more about my findings, as always.
