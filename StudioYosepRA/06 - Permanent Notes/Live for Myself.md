Have you ever come to a point where you are absolutely helpless in life? You are on the brink of giving up, but you know that giving up was never the answer. However at the same time, you also don't know how to go on with your life from here on. We don't want to give up, yet we also have no idea what to do. This is where I am at this moment.

It has been at least half a year I have been jobless. During this time, I resolve myself to take a rest and study. However, my resolve went unanswered with my inaction. Whenever I try something that I think will move my life forward, I got cold feet and scared. In the end, everything is fruitless. 

I've never feel this barren in life before. I really don't know what to do, or where to go. I would be lying if I say that I've never thought about ending it all. Thankfully, those thoughts were instantly put on halt before its seeds enter the soil. Not only do I think that giving up was never the answer, but more importantly, to end it all is one of the worst sin there is. I will live until I die, this has been my unwavering resolve since forever. Although despite my resolve to continue on living, the fact remains that I don't know what to do, or where to go.

Right now, I'm basically bankrupt. And least to say, I've become a big burden to my family to feed me as a 26 years old man. It's a pathetic story, I know it better than anyone else. Add to this pathetic story the fact that I'm spiraling into the feeling of helplessness brought me a sense of utter despair. So much that I can't find a better word to describe it as I face the endless void as I write this post.

Why do I feel helpless, though? It's a looming question in my head for a long time. Whenever mankind finds a problem, he will try to find a solution, and work hard to make it a reality, simply in order for him to survive another day. Strangely enough, I seemingly lack the desire or drive to solve my own problems. Is it apathy? Or is it despair? Or perhaps, a mix of both. I seemingly lack this essential desire to survive. Or at least, I didn't show it explicitly because once I encounter a situation where my life is threatened, I think I would follow my survival instinct too.

In regards to mankind's survival instincts, there is one truth that is consistent throughout our lifespan as a species, it's that no matter how comfortable or despondent that we can't help ourselves to move forward in our life, when we encounter a moment where our very lives is threatened, we would inevitably *help ourselves* in order for us to survive. It's like standing on a beach as we carelessly see the horizon. We may not care about how the sea began or why the water tastes salty that if the sea flipped upside down, we won't care. However, once you see a huge wave from afar indicating a tsunami, you won't be able to help yourself but heed on your instinct to survive and run, as pointless of an act they may be.

In my case, I was looking at the ever so uncaring ocean, until I see the wave that I chose to move. I didn't care if the world is destroyed by some silly reason such as dispute of war. But in the end, once I saw my wave, I chose to move regardless. The wave which I mentioned is my utter hatred and distaste towards becoming a burden to someone else.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm now bankrupt. I have so little in my pocket that I don't know if it can feed me, and I live on a mercy of my family. They may not question it, but I know that at least they have a thought or question as to whether I'm not getting a job already. They may think I'm lazy, uncommitted, freeloader, and whatnot. Thought these may not entirely true, but it's the truth that they don't know what I've been facing all this time. 

Be that as it may, and people can say whatever they like. However, once I realize the fact that I'm being a pathetic burden to my family, I discover (or rediscover) my utter hatred of being a burden to someone else's life. At one point in my youth, I made a resolve to not rely on other people, because I understand that each person had their own burden to bear that it's unfair that they bear mine too. Then at one point, I realized that it's okay for me to rely on those around me, such as my mother, and I forgo my resolve to not rely on other people.

Then it comes to this point where I have yet become what I distaste the most, which is being a burden to other people. **Thus I conclude, at this moment, that relying on other people makes me forget how to rely on myself.** The more I rely on others, the more I forget how to live on my own strength. That's why I have become to be crippled of trusting myself, my own heart, mind, and strength to solve my own problems. 

Not only that, the more I rely on others, the more I *listen to them* and regard what they say as truth more than what I think of myself. That's why I continue to berate myself for being a burden and my fear that I won't be able to become a reliable person, because these thoughts are becoming more and more true as I went through life.

This is my resolve. I want to rely on myself, and only myself. I will put myself above others when it comes to my own existence. I will listen to my own heart first before I entertain what others may say. I will solve my own problem using my own hands and get them dirty. Finally, if my own resolve somehow benefits other people, then be it. But I refuse to acknowledge it as the main reason as to why my efforts are able to help other people. Because in the end, I *chose* to do that for myself, and myself only.

What is written above may appear egotistical, to the point where I don't care about other people's life. To a certain extent, yes, that is true. Ultimately, I don't care about other people's life. However, I will take care of myself so that my heart won't grow so cold that I won't offer kindness to those who deserve it. 

I want to live for myself. And if what I do in life somehow able to help other people, then do whatever with it. Ultimately, I don't care about what is outside me because I do all of these for myself. Because I live for myself.
