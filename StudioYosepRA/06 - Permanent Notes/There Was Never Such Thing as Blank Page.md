"To develop a good question to write about \[…] one must already have put some thought into a topic. \[…] to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic. \[…] decision to read something and not something else is rooted in prior understanding, and that didn't come out of thin air."

"Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours."

\- Ahrens, Sönke. _How to Take Smart Notes_. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2017.

For people who have delved in creative endeavors long enough, and are humble enough to accept the fact that there is nothing truly new under the sun, must have understood that the "blank page" was never truly a problem. 

It's that moment when you stare at the white empty page as you start a new project. The fear of the endless amount of possibilities, the fear that one stroke of our pen and brush may spell a still born to our initial idea, the fear that we may not be able to finish this piece of project. It's a very real fear that all of us creative person have encountered many times in our life. Or at least we thought as much before we encounter the truth that nothing is ever new under the sun. That originality is just a buzzword thrown by those who can't see the supposed original work's connections to the prior works from many different sources.

Let's take an example of writing a good-old essay from your beloved college professor. Suppose you don't know how to "properly" write essay, and you try to find self-help books out there to guide you. The first lines of the book is likely to be similar to “To make your research more efficient, your first step should be to narrow the aspect you choose to focus on and also formulate an explicit question that your research and analysis will address.” Then it will be followed by twelve steps to how to write an essay, or something similar to that.

What I'm saying is that these books assume that you always start from scratch with your essays. But that's hardly the truth. Every intellectual endeavors starts from an already existing preconception. This prior preconception lays as the basis of your current project, in order for you to develop it further into something bigger. In turns, your current project will then serve as the basis of your next projects.

Besides that, when you are supposed to pick up your topic, how do you base your thoughts on when you are choosing your essay's topic? Surely this doesn't come out of thin air too. The decision is made based on what you already know. In order to do so, one must have read quite a bit of books and certainly not just about one topic. And the decision to cherry-pick which source material you should consume for your essay can only come from your experience of what you've read in the past. This way, you can classify what kind of book that you should read, and which one you should ignore for this one particular project.

It's the problematic preconception that *eureka* moments can only occur out of a spur. That brilliant and "original" idea can only be produced by those who are truly talented. That people who can't come up with a brilliant idea whenever they want are ordinary human.

Ideas are about finding connections between past knowledges. What people call *geniuses* are those who accumulate information and find connections between them faster than other people. So that when their findings make an appearance to the public, other people can't help but be awed at the invention.

I believe that the truly talented and genius people do exist. But that doesn't mean that ordinary people, like you and I, can't utilize what we have to produce great works. It's a world abundant in knowledge and information. We have a choice to live a life of continuous learning. As we accumulate more and more knowledge, and build meaningful connections between these nodes, our foundation can only grow stronger over time. You may not have a way to apply these knowledge to solve real-world problem yet for now, but your future self will thank you for the knowledge you have heartily accumulate up to that point because it will help with the problem that he is currently facing right now.
