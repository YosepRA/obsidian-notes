When life gets boring, when one doesn't know where to go or what to do, it is often a call to explore beyond one's comfort zone. It is something like when I'm used to write with my right hand, now I'll try to write with my left. Or if I'm being comfortable in my routine to learn some low level stuff in software development, then I would flip the table and build a project instead. It needs to be drastic enough to pull one from their comfort zones. And this is when we need to set and plan out a new goal in life.

Setting up goals is easy to think about, but difficult in practice. I'm ashamed to admit that I'm not the most committed person when it comes to goals which I set by myself. I would follow the plan for one or two days, but once the signs of laziness that results in deviation of plans appears in my routine, it would be rather easy for me to drop out and see my plans scattered about. There were many measures that I tried to take care of this "circumstances" that may appear, such as making the deadline as lax deadline rather than something that must be fulfilled on time. But alas, none has worked so far as I keep getting discouraged whenever I miss the goal.

One part about setting up goals is deadline, the amount of time required to finish the goal. This part  has been the most difficult for me to deal with. For one, I don't know (or perhaps, no one ever knows) exactly how long does a task take. I think all of us can agree that we miss our deadlines for about 80% of the time, at the very least. Circumstances can appear in whatever shape and form that could delay the progress of our works. However, to a certain extent, missing deadlines is tolerable. Though I'm not saying that we must not commit ourselves to fulfill our deadlines to our best of abilities. But I don't like to think that missing deadlines could spell the end of the world for anyone involved, aside from very few cases, of course.

The other tricky part of setting up goals is volume, the size of the goals in order for us to perceive them as achievable. Setting up goals can be tricky if the goals are too broad. Say I have a goal to go somewhere. Somewhere... Where exactly? Oh, to the far city. Yeah, how far exactly? Oh, that one city at the edge off our island. Okay, maybe you're talking about Banyuwangi (a city in Java, Indonesia), but how and when will you get there?

The question goes on, and on, and on. You see that if the goal isn't specific enough, the brain would find it hard to perceive how much time or effort left that is required for us to achieve our goals. It's akin to eating a whole cake. There is no way that you can fit 30 cm diameter cake in one bite. You need to cut the cake into a size that fits into a small plate first. But even then, you need to cut your cake even further with your fork, so that it can fit your mouth and you can eat it comfortably.

Combining and finding the right balance between time and volume is the tricky one for me. Aside from that, I also need to forgive myself if I couldn't follow my own plans to a tee. However, if I can find the right balance to this formula that fits me perfectly, then I think it's going to be a breakthrough for my whole life. If I were to find it, then perhaps, I wouldn't have to be worried to get lost ever again.

Let's tackle it one part at a time, and start with the volume. I think I don't need anything more complicated than a simple bucket list. It's just a list of item, and when I'm done with it, I can cross it. Dead simple, there is no need to elaborate more.

However, I do need to elaborate more about the items that I put in. My current bucket list could be problematic for me. They are like this:

- Study SICP.
- Build personal website with blogging feature.
- Study computer system.

This list is straightforward enough to follow. However, the problem lies in the lack of motivation, of "why" I should do all those things. I would go and open the SICP book, read a few pages, gets bored, then ponder about why I want to read this anyway. There goes the fire, blown off by the lack of motivation that I think should be cleared in the planning stage.

Therefore, instead of listing out "what" activities that I want to do, I need to list out "why" I want to do many different things. It's going to be similar to this:

- I want to learn low level programming concept using programming language that is used by CS students.
- I want to build a platform where I can share my daily activities and to record my journey through writing journals.
- I want to learn how computer peripherals work on low levels. How do processors transfer data between different components? How do memories retain the temporary data in an effective manner? How do hard drives store data for a long time?

From these stems of statements, I could then branch it out further using sub-lists to *cut down the cake,* so that I can start to bite it. As for how small I can go, I would say *as small as I can.* The clear indication would be my guts feelings that  I can fit this item into my mouth. The further and more elaborate bucket list would be like this:

- I want to learn low level programming concept using programming language that is used by CS students.
	- Read SICP
		- Read chapter 1.
		- Read chapter 2.
- I want to build a platform where I can share my daily activities and to record my journey through writing journals.
	- Rebuild StudioYosepRA to add blogging feature in it.
	- Build a social media presence by planning out small content to share bits about my daily developer activities.
- I want to learn how computer peripherals work on low levels. How do processors transfer data between different components? How do memories retain the temporary data in an effective manner? How do hard drives store data for a long time?
	- Read Nand2Tetris book.
		- Play with simulators to demonstrate how the components connect with each other.

Again, the list could go on and on until I size it down to bitable chunks. As for the tool that I would use to record these goals, I think I would settle for a plain Word document. I mean, I could use Kanban boards such as in ClickUp. But I feel like ClickUp won't be able to perfectly fit my plan. Good thing I'm a developer. So right now, I'm thinking about building a web app to fit my goal setting needs. In fact, I'm going to record the idea in my "ideas scratchpad" memo now.

The next part is time. As for deadline settings, I could go no further than my honest estimation. Really, I don't think there is any other best or calculated method other than the one that is determined by experience. However, the problem is not about estimating the time required to achieve a goal, but rather what to do if I miscalculate the deadline.

Missing deadlines, especially the ones that I set myself, can be discouraging to a whole different level. See, I want to become a man who can walk the talk. If I say that I can finish this task within a week, then I will do my absolute best to finish it in one week. However, as I mentioned earlier, circumstances can pop up. Yes, sometimes I could fulfill the deadline on time, even with a much more arduous effort than I had expected. But it is not rare for me to extend it because of other wild circumstances that may appear.

When I miss my deadlines, I get disappointed with myself. And that branches out further to when said circumstances happen, I would sometimes get upset — although quietly — at these external circumstances. But again, I need to emphasize to myself that these are *external circumstances.* What is outside my body and mind can rarely be controlled. If they happen, let them happen. What I can do is to adjust myself to the new situation that occur, like all of us do in life.

So, adjust. How to adjust my plans to the new circumstances? I think there may be time when I need to adjust the deadline, and some other time when I need to adjust the item. Although, what likely to change more often would the former because circumstances will happen in every day as I do my routines to achieve each goals. As for the items, I don't think it would change often in general. Probably some items would be sidelined for a new priority that appear. However, I don't think there will be a need to massively change the structure of the items if I have determined the bite-sized chunks.

I think that's pretty much it. After this, I will jump into a new Word document to list out things that I want to do. I may write further development of this system in another note. Thank you.
