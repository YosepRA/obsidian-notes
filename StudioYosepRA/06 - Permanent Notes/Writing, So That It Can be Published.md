"Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published."

\- Ahrens, Sönke. _How to Take Smart Notes_. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2017.

It's easy to make this kind of mistake when writing notes. I mean, we all know how to take notes ourselves, right? Underline it, write something on a margin, or even write an excerpt on a different page. We know how to spot an interesting line and write a note about it. I mean, it's what I'm doing right now, and it's how I approach note-taking so far. But after reading parts of *How to Take Smart Notes* where it explains about the way to approach our writings, I realize that my approach may be mistaken, or at least incomplete.

So far, I've been writing in a similar way as I write my diaries. Meaning, I often use first person and write as if I'm talking to myself and giving advices to him. Perhaps, this is not quite a proper way to write a note in a way that is advised by the book.

Again, we all know how to write notes as mentioned above. Often, we spend more time in refining only our reading and writing skills, but we stop at that. We may end up with many notebooks, but then we will inevitably find it hard to navigate or explore through these notebooks. I know it because I experience it the hard way. I wrote notes this way, and I only end up with a piles of Word files that are basically impossible to review and trace its origin. I needed to change this approach and that's why I choose to read *How to Take Smart Notes.*

Mr. Ahrens claims that the problems lies not in a way we read, write, and organize our writings, but rather that we can't *differentiate* between good notes and bad notes.

Ideally, we think, we should bring our notebook everywhere we go. If we find anything interesting, we write it down. Often, we would stop at that. All the notes are within your notebook, but it's difficult for us to open it back up and explore those ideas further. Why? Because we didn't think much when we write it. Therefore, discounting all of the writings within your notebooks as *not that good of a writing.*

Now imagine if at the end of the day, after you are done writing all of these random notes, that you quickly skim through it, pick up an interesting idea, then *write a proper text* for it. This time we write to achieve quality, writing in order to *publish* it for other people to read.

We are now thinking in terms of writing quality essays or papers. It's a different mindset altogether compared to jotting down random notes. When we imagine ourselves writing for a publication, surely we would do our best in our writing, wouldn't we? Doing so forces us to really put our thoughts in our writing. Once we spend this much effort in writing a quality essay, then it would be hard for us to discount these essays as mere notes. We would have an inclination to save it and explore it later on the future.

"Even though the slip-box, being organised bottom-up, does not face the trade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can lose its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately. It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a _critical mass_, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled."

Mr. Ahrens further explains to achieve a critical mass, it's crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes:

1. *Fleeting notes*
   These are only reminders of information. Write it however you like because it won't be a problem if we throw it in the trash within a day or two.
2. *Permanent notes*
   These are the real meat. You write it as best as you can because it will be stored in the same way in the same place, and it will be stored forever.
3. *Project notes*
   Notes that are related to one particular project. They are kept within project-specific folder, and they can be thrown away or archived once the project finished. Perhaps "project" means not only project literally, but also books or other source materials for your study. I, for example, am not likely to revisit *How to Take Smart Notes* book note later on.

Make a good differentiation between these three types of notes. Put your best effort to write your permanent notes and insert it into your slip-box. Because you will often visit your slip-box whenever you want. And because you will often visit it, you would want these notes to contain quality writing and they are easy to read, wouldn't you? Your slip-box is your second, breathing brain after all.
