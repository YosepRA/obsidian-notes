Making decision is hard. We have to keep our touch on necessary information to choose the most insightful decision possible. To collect said information and to ruminate over them require an exhaustive amount of energy, be it our brain or our willpower. So much that too much of decision making in a day can turn even the most capable person to a couch potato at the end of the day.

In whatever we do, it's a lot easier to go through our work if we don't have to make too much decision. Imagine having to spend your morning on choosing which of your tens of shirt to use, or whether you should have a meeting with your peers right now or later after lunch, or whether you should write your notes on your usual notebook or on the sticky notes. These seemingly trivial decisions are also taking our energy all the same compared to something larger like a business decision.

Making decision is hard, and also tiresome. I always find it easier to work when I have a clear and flexible enough structure in the way I work. For example, the way I write my notes ever since I read *How to Take Smart Notes.* Not only do I write much more than usual, I also no longer need to make a decision as to how to write my notes. I like writing my notes in a form of mini-essays in order for me to elaborate on a point. I love seeing these notes naturally form connection and grow together. I like how all I need to do is to just sit down and write. As long as they are appropriately written, meaning that it can be read easily not only by myself, but also other people. 

The system is clear and flexible enough that I can just focus on writing. I no longer have questions on how to write my notes, where to write it, or where to store it. All I have to do is just sit down, open my books, and read with intention to write them down in my own words, as properly as I can. Since then, I discovered how fun studying could be. Or at least I'm being reminded of how fun studying always was to me.
