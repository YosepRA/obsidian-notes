I don't know how many times I have read Nathaniel Branden's *The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem.* When I think I get what it means to be confident, then I forget it the next day. However, this is the first time I'm reading the book with a note on my side. And this note is the first one for this book.

"Self-esteem, fully realized, is the experience that we are appropriate to life and to the requirements of life.
1. Confidence in our ability to think, confidence in our ability to cope with the basic challenges of life.
2. Confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being worthy, deserving, entitled to assert our needs and wants, achieve our values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts."

Branden started with a great summary for his book, and for his entire life's research. Confidence, in its very essence, is the confidence in one's ability to live a proper life, and the confidence in one's rights to be happy. Words can't describe how fitting this summary is to whenever I feel down and not confident in anything.

The first one is the confidence in one's ability to live a proper life. When I'm feeling depressed, all I can think of is how useless I am and my efforts are. No matter what I do, no matter what my brain try to conjure, I don't have even the slightest of confidence that it's going to work. When faced with challenges of life, I can't imagine myself facing it head-on with courageous heart. All I can imagine is my meek self, sulking, crying, and making myself the smallest in the universe in the presence of life's challenges. You don't need to tell me how pathetic I am, because I know how pathetic I truly am. And to have this state of mind day in day out for weeks, or even months, isn't the healthiest mindset to be in as it would easily spiral out of control.

The second one is the confidence in our rights to be happy. Isn't it weird that we have to be conscious of our *rights* to be happy? Yes, it is weird. And yes, it's also true. Whenever I'm down in the dumpster, I always felt that I'm undeserving of life. That I've wasted this 24 hours of my day crying, sulking, and pity-partying. The more I do this, the more it all spirals down to the feeling of undeserving of life. Again, it creates the most devious and evil spiral mankind has ever encountered. Because once you enter the spiral, often unknowing to yourself, you will enter the most unpleasant feeling to have. And worst of all, it can lead you to the thought of giving it all up and "end it all."

Without those two things, it's hard to understand what self-esteem is. How can I feel confident in the presence of life's challenges if I doubt myself? How can I pursue for a peaceful life if I feel undeserving of it? How can I get out of this spiral if I don't even realize that I've stuck my feet inside it and I don't try to get out of it?

Therefore, I read this book once again. And now, I have my notes with me so that I genuinely learn from it by writing it into a series of notes. Hopefully, this book can give me wisdom so that I can notice when I have my foots on this spiral, and how I can get out of it.
