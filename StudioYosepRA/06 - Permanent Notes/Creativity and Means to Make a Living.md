Every time I'm about to work on something, there is always this sense of doubt about what I'm doing. I'm all too familiar with this feelings, which are my fears of failure and not being good enough. I've talked and wrote about it a few times already, so I won't repeat myself. I already know the answer for both of them, which is that one will never be good enough, as in the definition of "good enough" would extend to eternity, and what one can do is to just do what one need to do. It's an ever so simple elixir for these problems, and perhaps timeless as well. However, despite understanding all of that, I still face this block feeling of doubt on daily basis that makes me question my desire to walk this path.

Being creative feels good. I don't think I need to elaborate more on this feeling, but I do know that I enjoy the feeling of being creative. Whenever I listen to the call, do the work, and finish it, I would always feel this sense of satisfaction that fills my heart to the brim. And all of these experiences were not filled by how good my works turned out to be, but rather by answering to the call and putting the honest works. These are the experience that I would willing to work on, and I thought this sentiment would be enough to drive me forwards from here on. Alas, this is likely not be the case.

See, I don't have money right now. I'm living on my parents' supports, mainly my grandmother and mother, as a 26 years old man. Every day, I would wake up in a shameful feeling that I couldn't feed myself and my family. In my head, there is always this relentless push on my back to earn a living. Then this feeling is clashing, or even get amplified, with my fear of failure and not being good enough. I mean, how can I find a job if I'm not capable of doing the job, right? Although this may not be the truth or even reality in and of itself, but it is true that these feelings continue to grind my soul day in day out, awake or asleep.

I understand what I want, or at least wish to have. I wish for a live of eternal creativity and growth. I dream for a living where I can be as creative as I can every day, and a living where I can learn and study an abundant amount of skills that I could ever hoped for. I understand how long this path is going to be, and I'm willing to live it. However... This wish clashes with my issue of mortality. A need to make a living.

How can I exert my desire of creative living if I'm constantly worried about whether I could eat today or not? It's near impossible for me to focus on what is helpful if I'm constantly worried about my mortality. It's a devastating spiral to be in. My constant worries feed negativity to my everyday works, and it deepens my worries even more when I end up not doing the works. As I said again, it is grinding on my very soul. To the point where I feel guilty of living.

I'm not so conceited or arrogant to think that I am the one who fulfill my own needs. No. I have God in my life, and He has always been the one who fills my daily needs. However, my faith doesn't mean that I can just sit around and wait for blessings to come down from the sky. I need to earn it, not in a way that I put in the work because I deserve to get fed, but rather I simply want to take part in God's grace.

I don't want to be guilty of living. I have so much projects to build and skills to learn and hone. I don't want my days to be filled with this worries and guilt. I want my days to be filled with excitement as I continue on working on my projects or honing my skills. I want my nights to be filled with hope and excitement as I plan for work tomorrow, and not worry about whether I can live tomorrow.

I don't want to treat my everyday works as a mean to an end to fulfill my needs or defeat my fears. I want to be creative because it is an inevitability. It's inevitable because this is what I do, and this is how I choose to live.
