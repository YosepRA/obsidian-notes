'If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. '

[James 1:5-6](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JAS.1.5-6)

It is often funny when I think of myself. Although I don't pray as much lately, however, whenever I choose to pray and humble myself before God and ask for His wisdom, He would always show me tons of stuff. I would ask Him for so many things, such as my heartbreak of the day, something that makes me sad, or disheartened. And the answer that I get in my prayer would often, nay, **always** be wisdom from God. Before I know it, I would speak thousands of words of wisdom that I would have a hard time coming up with. 

The words of advices and wisdom continues to flow through my heart, mind, and finally to my mouth as I continue to word it out. From the end of each prayer, I would feel peaceful and grateful for the wisdom that He has given to me. With that comes a hope, both from my Lord and myself, that I would apply it in my life as soon as possible. But alas, it has proven to be my biggest hurdle yet in my journey with the Lord.

Having faith in the Lord is such a tricky thing to have. To walk in faith with Him is truly easier said than done. But mind you, in my prayer this morning, I don't believe walking in faith with God is a difficult thing to do. Difficult not in similar term as you have to push a boulder to the top of the mountain. But rather it's difficult because it goes directly against what we *logically* know.

It is akin of a loving father and his chicken-hearted yet adorable child. The child is about to learn how to swim in the pool. The father is waiting for the child in the pool as he ask the child to trust him and jump into the water. However, being scared as the child was, the child continues to imagine the worst that could possibly happen from him jumping into the pool. Sometimes, the child would be courageous enough to dip their feet to the pool. But oftentimes after that, they would back five steps away from the pool as he imagines more fear than they initially would. Then continues the child's guilt for disappointing their father and not trusting in him as the child watches their father still waiting in the pool.

This is my faith as of late. With how much I understood about God and how humble and kind-hearted He is to show me all sorts of wisdom, my faith is still akin of that chicken-hearted child. One day, I would have courage to do face one of my fear. But then, I would track back and not be courageous for the next five days. In the end, I would often feel guilty of not trusting my Lord.

Whenever I pray, God has **always** given me wisdom. Whenever I ask, He would always answer. I can listen to His voice and I can feel His ever presence in my day-to-day life. With how much God has given me, logically thinking, it should more, way more than enough that I can walk full of conviction and steadfastness. If my God tells me to build this project, all I need to answer is "Yes, Lord" and get on working. If my God tells me to talk to a certain someone, all I need to answer is "Yes, Lord" and approach that person. It has always been that simple and I'm convinced that God never intended for it to be as complicated as we always thought.

Let my ears open to your voice, let my heart be courageous to take the first step, and let your strength be mine so that I can continue on walking. I thank you once again, Lord, for the wisdom that you have given me for today.
