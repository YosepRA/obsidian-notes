Human brain is such a magnificent piece of organ in our body. Created by God with all of his omniscience and might. It has helped us evolved as a species over this many of years to build a society as elaborate as we have now. However, if there is one weakness about this brain of ours, or at least my own brain, is that we couldn't rely on it too much to remember anything beyond what we do today.

It's ironic because when we are thinking about brain, then we are thinking about "memory". It's a place for us to store and preserve our thoughts and ideas. It's only given that our brain can recall what happen to us that night 12 years ago, isn't it? But alas, the reality isn't so simple because I often forgot something as simple as whether I changed my clothes yesterday or not.

The point is I don't think despite its reputation as our memory, we can't truly rely on our brain to remember literally about everything we experience in life. It's very much unreliable as you forgot what happen 80% of yesterday. That's why we find ways to preserve these memories *outside* of our brain. One of such way is, of course, writing.

If you want to remember something, write it. This sentence has become a mantra when it comes to studying. As written in the reference notes, it's important to approach our writing with an intention of publication, shared with others, and future revisit by ourselves. Therefore, it will be worth it to put your best effort in these writings, and put it inside our slip-box, where all of our best writings live their life. 

As you continuously write these quality notes and make a proper connection between each other, you will build up a web of knowledge, a permanent reservoir of your lifelong learning journey which you can share with others, revisit, and further explore later on in the future. In a lot of senses, you will never lose these thoughts. It's as if this web of knowledge is your second breathing brain.

Now, let's look at the contrary where either you don't properly build up your slip-box, or even don't write at all, what will happen then? Well, as stated in the first paragraph, it will be very unlikely for you to retain what you learn in the past. You can only rely on those which have been ingrained in your muscle memory, and sometimes recall this one particularly memorable knowledge that you have learned in your college days. It will be very much unreliable as if you weren't truly study back in the days.

Imagine every book that you have read and lectures you have attended. You may or may not have written notes back then, and perhaps you still have it right now. But will you be able to relive those memories with your notes? Had it been me, I would have a hard time.

Why does it happen, I wonder? Yes, perhaps we did our best writing our notes and preserve it to this day. But if we can't revisit those memories, it will be a pity. Not only that, since we only wrote our notes related to that one particular book or lecture, we didn't explore *any ideas* that may appear as we wrote about that one book or lecture. Least to say, those ideas may have gone to waste. 

We chose to limit ourselves to the boundary of that one book or lecture that we didn't explore our thoughts further. Perhaps it was because we only care about writing notes related to our source materials to pass our exams or finish our project that we didn't care enough about further exploration of thoughts. Again, it's a pity because this is where the great things are. If one is willing to spend enough effort to write a quality notes, then store it in a slip-box, these collection of ideas may build up into something great later.

It's worth it to build our slip-box. Not only does it train your thinking abilities by having a habit  of writing quality notes, it will also help you preserve all of the knowledge that you have attained so far in your life. In a series of papers that are both insightful and easy to read, you will grow to appreciate your past effort and continually use your slip-box, your second brain, in your lifelong learning journey.
