Have you ever been asked to do something so difficult that you can't possibly imagine yourself achieving such feat? Then in your fear of failure, you would freeze up and unable to do anything productive to find out a solution about it, or even admit to your task giver that you don't know how to do it. Either way, you would often come to a reply from your task giver that you don't have a "can do" mentality, and thus you are a failure any way.

In my fear of failure, "can do" mentality has been one of the most difficult part for me to accept as a professional. I'm shy to admit that I don't know something. However, if I have a choice to say that I can't do something, I would say it, even if I have to bear the societal shame. 

Generally, I am a willing learner, as long as I have time to learn it. But, time is rarely a commodity as anyone would expect everyone to be able to do everything from the get go. This is exactly where I have problem accepting. 

I understand that as a professional, it's of paramount importance that I can do my job with as little errors as I can. I too want to do my best in doing my job to achieve a good results. *Sigh...* I'm struggling to not write something that doesn't make me sound like a victim. But this is a dilemma, indeed.

To put it succinctly, I understand that I need to make as little mistake as I can; however, I also understand that I can't possibly know everything at any given time. What is certain is that there will be a time when anyone in this world do not know something. And for me, the attitude in the presence of our lack of knowledge makes the greatest difference in tackling this challenge. Some people would lie that they know what they are doing, while also pulling his hair out for saying such lie at the same time in his heart. Some people would admit that they can't do it, and even though they are willing to learn, they are not given time to learn.

Again, two things are true to me. One, I want to do my best in doing my job with every bit of knowledge that is in my brain to achieve the best possible outcome. Two, there is time when I honestly don't freaking know what I'm doing or what to do with something. And above everything else, I am willing to learn. I am willing to expand myself further in order to gain more knowledge and grow as a human being. For that, not only do I need to put real effort to the table, but also *time* for me to learn it. However, I also understand that time is not mine alone.

Being a "can do" man isn't about being a perfect worker, always knowing everything and can do everything. I believe, it's rather a conviction that one can learn in any and all situations. Yes, there will be time when I'm absolutely ignorant about something. However, I am willing to offer myself and learn how to do it. 

With this, I realize that time is absolutely out of my control. I can give myself as much time as I can. However, with time being a shared commodity, I can't truly control it to provide me with enough time to learn. So, I would just pray that whoever is sharing the time commodity with me would be willing to let me learn and share their time with me.

I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me.
