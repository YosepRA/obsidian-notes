Can you ride a bike? Do you remember the first time you rode your bike? Have you ever fallen when you try to kick the pedal, but you kicked it too hard that the bike went too fast, and then you fall to the ground? If you did, did you remember how painful the wound it gave to one of your elbow, knee, and perhaps cheek? Have you ever thought of giving up, but at the same time you don't want to? Then finally to conclude the story, do you remember the moment when you succeeded pedaling with both of your legs, as you can feel the wind went through your once wounded elbows, knees, and cheeks? Do you remember... how happy it makes you feel?

I can still remember where my bicycle wound was. It was on my right knee and a bit on my right elbow too. My right knee's wound was quite awful for my age at the time that I have to strap it for a little over one week. Honestly, I couldn't remember how I felt at the time. Could I have been disheartened, discouraged, or happy, I would never know. But one thing I know is that once the wound healed up, I asked my grandmother if I can ride my bike once again. And she said okay.

I couldn't remember how long it took me to succeed on it, but I do clearly remember the feeling of the wind on my cheeks, body, and legs. It was as if, quite literally, like I was riding the wind. I felt so happy of my perseverance that I rode my bike on the field for too many laps to count. Not until it's almost dusk do I return home and simply told my grandma that I've managed to ride my bike.

It's such a simple story, yet I somehow recall it once I read a passage on *The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem* about how high self-esteem individual would challenge for difficult tasks, then reaching such goal nurtures good self-esteem. While on the other hand, low self-esteem individual would seek the safety of familiarity and undemanding tasks. Confining oneself to the familiar and undemanding serves to weaken self-esteem.

At that point, I get reminded again of a passage from *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. I couldn't recall exactly what it was, but it's about every action that one do that is aligned to one's identity is a vote towards that identity. Say I am a developer. When I continually and consistently do activities that is related about being a developer, then those activities becomes a "vote" for my identity as a developer. Therefore, strengthening my conviction and genuine effort for me to learn and work as a developer.

Thus the title of this note, "One Courageous Step is One Vote for Your Wellbeing." When I first tried riding my bike, I took the courageous leap. Then once I succeeded in riding it, I no longer have fear, or to be more precise "resistance" from doing the same thing. When I first tried building a Tic-Tac-Toe app using JavaScript, I took the courageous leap. Once I succeeded in building the app, I was so happy that I was able to put what I learned from books into a web application written entirely on my own. In these points of time and moment, I am the happiest man in the world.

These little successes that is coming from challenges which I set for myself, and the courage that I took to take a leap are what determines my wellbeing. Right now, I feel scared of facing life. These challenges are definitely another set of bicycles for me to learn to ride on. The more I choose to be fearful of riding these bicycles, the more I'd be crippled in life. And this inaction becomes yet another vote to my beliefs and convictions that I *cannot* face life's challenges. Yes, this vote system indeed goes both ways.

Therefore, to outvote the opposition, the self who believes that I cannot face life, then I need to put more votes into my courage to take the leaps of faith. The more leaps I take, the more I will experience life. And the more I experience life, the more line I could write about myself in my life's book. In the end, facing life's challenges (riding these bicycles) will be yet another funny stories that I could tell to anyone later on in the future, just like how I told a story about my first time riding my bike.
