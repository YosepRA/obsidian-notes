Isn't it a pleasant feeling to be proven right on something? When we predict that today is going to rain, and then when the rain does happen, we tell our coworkers and by the jolly of the victor we say "See? What did I tell you?"

We would do anything to be on the right side of history, as subjective our view of life may be. But, we strive to be "right" in every waking moment of our life. Starting from the way we dresses, how we do our work, how we converse with our peers, even what we eat for dinner tonight. Whenever we are proven to be right, there is this sense of accomplishment and justification for predicting the right thing and perhaps doing the right thing as well.

However, the tragedy of our strive to be right can also spread to many other parts of our life. And one of them is how we view ourselves. Take myself for example. I feel inappropriate and insufficient to live my life. I never feel that I have what it takes to live a noble life. I don't think my voice and idea matters, so I won't bother sharing my thoughts to others. Along with many other set of twisted beliefs and convictions, I continue to convince myself to be "right" about myself. Slowly and surely, my conviction becomes the truth of my life as how I am right now.

When all of these things happen, I feel a slight sense of relief, albeit twisted as it is, when I'm proven right. I often say to myself "I expected this anyway", often an attempt to relief myself of the pain and suffering of life.

It truly is a land of self-fulfilling prophecies. What I tell myself is what becomes the truth. Of course, it's very much possible for me and all of us to turn this around. However, it's also clear that it takes much more than talking to the mirror and pep talk ourselves. I've never done it anyway, so I won't start either. 

The only way, I think, to face this challenge is to turn up the self-fulfilling prophecies to the opposite way. When I'm feeling not confident in my craft, I should create anyway. When I'm feeling I'm not good enough to face life's challenges, I should face today's challenges with honest of heart anyway. These actions which go against my initial convictions, if I were to succeed in these small steps, it would turn my initial convictions on its head and turning it into a false belief. When something is false, I can't never think of it as the truth.

What you believe is what you do. On the other hand, it's also true that what you do is what you believe. It's the same as the relation between mind and body. What the mind does, the body does. What the body does, the mind does. These parts of our body and mind are ever so interconnected and inseparable. How much we want to differentiate between the two, we won't be able to separate it, as they are one existence to begin with.

Therefore, do your best to prove yourself wrong. As it is the wise who admit their mistakes and false beliefs, and the fool who continue to stand in their conviction without an effort to challenge or question it.
