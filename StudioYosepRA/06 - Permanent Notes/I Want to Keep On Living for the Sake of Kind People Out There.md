I am lost in life. I'm in a state where I don't know what to do, where to go, or even whether I want to continue on living. No, I'm not in the state where I would end my life. Because I see such action as the lowest of all where it is the most insulting thing to do for anyone who is ever given the breath of life. For however long I live, I would never end my own life, whether it deliberate or not.

I apologize for a dark introduction, but I need to make it clear for myself and anyone who may read this note that I truly see such action as the lowest of all that a man can do. That even if I'm this low in life, I would never stoop so low to do such thing. Even when I'm in my worst state just like how I am right now, I too still desire to live after all.

My life is empty. Or at least, it *feels* empty. I no longer feel thrilled with life itself as I see utmost despair wherever and whenever I look. I don't see a point in doing anything in life. Even including my aspiration to become a creative person. "What's the point?" I would ask myself. And until now, I may not have the answer.

Whenever I get like this, it would be a clear sign for a session of self reflection. This is an urgent call that I need to drop everything, sit on my bed, and get silent. And I just did exactly that. I had an urge to write exactly as what I've been thinking in this note. But I think I would let this note becomes yet another life in its own where I pour out my thoughts and feelings. Though I may still come up with the same concerns as I did in my reflection, but it's likely that I would express it in a different way in this note. So, let's start, shall we?

I am lost in life, as I said in the beginning of this note. Then I ask a question about what it is and why it is. I feel lost in life because I simply don't know what to do, where to go, or whether I want to continue living or not. As to why it happened, I think it is caused by the sheer amount of hopelessness and despair of this world that results in sheer apathetic behavior from myself.

This apathetic behavior branches far and wide to all directions, but it all sums up into *the* primary question of "What's the point?" whenever I think of starting to do something in life. However, I don't feel that this is caused by myself blaming the world for what it is. I don't think it's wise for me to blame anyone or anything because of my sadness and sorrow. If there is anything or anyone to blame, I would blame myself first and foremost. Even though I blame myself to a certain extent, I believe that this is not the root for my sorrow. Let's continue.

See, this is a world filled with sorrow and sadness. At every second, I would hear someone cry. At every corner, I would see injustice and pure corruption. At every spot, I would see people who are down in the dumpster like I am today. This is a truly sorrowful and wicked world, I won't argue or sugarcoat any of it. However... There is little to nothing I can do about it.

No, I don't think that I lack power to be the ally of justice. But I just think that it's unwise for me to spend my life and energy to fighting the inevitability of injustice in this world. Yes, I yearn for justice and fairness in this world. That the good people deserve to have a fulfilling life. And the bad people deserve to get punished for their crime. However, the world is the world. I may put a dent in it, but I will never be able to eradicate its filthy part off it. This is why I think it to be unwise to spend my life to be concerned over these things. Rather, it would do good for all people that I put my focus on something else entirely, which is the opposite of everything.

Yes. The world is truly vile and wicked. However, does that make it that there is only bad people out there? We all know that there are pure and gentle souls out there. There are people who live in kindness of heart, and uphold the value of justice and fairness in their heart and mind. We know this as a *fact* because we have met those kind of people out there.

Suppose the world is only filled with bad people doing the most atrocious thing. Then yes, there is no point in fighting for something good and fair in this world. Even if God decides to rain fire from heaven above, then I won't complain even if I am part of this world and try to live a good and fair life. However, I know for a fact that this is not true. There are good people out there who upholds the same value of kindness and justice out there as I do. And I know in absolute certainty that those kind of people don't deserve to be hopeless because of the atrocity of this world. Their kindness must be heard, and their kindness must be held up high.

The world is truly vile and wicked. But even then, the kind people still lives in it. And I think, this is more than enough reason for me to continue on living and fighting in this world. 

I want to become a master at software engineering and computer science. So that the programs or apps that I would create can reach those kind people in order so that it could make their life a tiny bit easier and give them hope and power to keep on living.

I want to become good at drawing, good enough so that I can draw and write stories with it. So that the illustrations or manga that I would create can help people cheer up, feel hopeful in life, and give them a tiny bit of wisdom so that they can keep on living.

I want to learn how to compose beautiful music using lovely instruments such as piano. So that my pieces can help soothe these kind people hearts and give them harmony in melodies just like how pieces that I've listened to helped me in my toughest time.

I want to do all that so that I can join these people to become the light of the world. If I give up now, one of those candle of light would die out, and one possibility of spreading kindness and hope would disappear from this world. I may only have a short life. But as long as live, God has given me the ability to do good things. And it is in my own hands to choose and spread the message of light using what God has given me ever since the beginning of life. God never ask me to be exceptional, He only asks me and all of His children to be good and do good. Because we were made fully capable of being good and doing good.

Yes, this is a vile and wicked world. Yes, there are atrocity wherever I look. And yes that despite so, there are people out there who sincerely believe in the value of goodness that God has given to them just like I do. Even if I never met these people, even if I would never meet these people, I feel that I am connected to them. As each of us become the candles of light illuminating the world with our gentle heart. If there is any one of us who gives up, then one of those lights would go out, and the world would go dimmer. And I don't want that to happen, to myself or any of these candles of light.

Therefore, this is my reason to live. *I would live for the sake of kind people in this world.* For I want to become one of the lights, I want to support these lights so that they can keep on living. And hopefully, I can also illuminate those who are living in the dark, so that they know what light is and so that they can have hope to keep on living like I do today.

This is my hope that God will sustain all of us who are willing to continue on living in this wicked world and keep on doing good. For this is what He wants from me, and many other of His children who are going through the same sorrow as I am.
