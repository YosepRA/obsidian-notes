Morning pages are pieces of writing that we write every morning before we start working. I got this idea from a book *The Artist's Way* by Julia Cameron. These writings shouldn't be too long that it forms an essay, and it is suggested to only spend about 15 minutes to write it.

The goal of morning pages is to flush out our thoughts before we work for a day. See, there is so much grumbling feelings when I wake up. It's difficult not to worry about many different things every day. Sometimes, I would face the day with excitement. But oftentimes, I would face it with dread and worry.

Along with writing morning pages, I also restart my habit of morning prayer and bible reading, which I have neglected for a while now. Because I believe that the start of the day is crucial in determining our mindset for the day. Whenever I start my day with too much social media, I would walk the day feeling groggy because not only do I bear the worries of my heart, I also bear the burden of whatever dose of news and toxicity from social media.

Daily prayer and morning pages could be my answer to deal with this problem. I also make a commitment, for a thousand times already, to not use Twitter or social media ever again. Man, I should let go of that platform. Yes, there are useful news about my games and football. But, the overall negativity and toxicity is too much for me to handle. This is rather a choice between maintaining the health of my mind, and keep on living on the edge and absorbing news more than I need.

Of course, I would need to keep myself updated to the news somehow. I had a plan of using the alternative channels of information for each of my topic of interests, which are:
1. Tech and software development
2. Video games
3. Football
4. General news

For tech and software development, I should hang out more in the Discord channels which I joined in. I should involve myself more in the community in a way that an introvert and a shy person like me can do. And Discord community channels should be a good answer for that. Other than that, I could also visit tech news websites more to scan the news for a 30 minutes or so every day.

As for video games and football, I think it would be enough if I scan the information on YouTube. I follow a few content creators for both topics, and I should have had enough information about this topic. Even though I shouldn't need that much information about this compared to tech news.

And for the last one is general news, involving global politics, news, and whatnot. I don't need as much information about this one other than quick scans of general news websites such as The New York Times, CNN, or BBC

That's it for the news today.
