My life always lies in the balance of having a plan, but not being able to achieve it, and living by intuition, but my intuition is suck that I end up being lazy. I don't want to elaborate too much about the latter, but all I can say that it doesn't work for me. I end up being *too grateful* that I don't take this life seriously. It makes me too humble that I become too timid to face life with an earnest heart. It's time to determine a direction in life and go all-in to it, no matter what.

There are advices on many sources that for a timid person like I am, when it comes to setting goals, I need to keep it "small and realistic." So that I won't become disheartened had I unable to achieve it. They say it's better to eat in small chunks, yet we are making progress, than having too big to swallow that it makes us choke ourselves to death.

However, after living all those advices, it is clear for me to see that it's not possible for me to make a series of bite-sized goals and live it. Or to be more precise, I don't like micro-managing how I walk in life too much. Say I currently have a goal to build my next rendition of StudioYosepRA, my personal website. I hate to break the tasks into too much of small pieces just to get myself to start working.

With that saying, yes, the problem lies yet again on me and myself only. I'm too much of a timid that I need to "cheer myself up" by setting a bunch of small goals and take my tiny bit steps at a time. For one, it's way too slow. For two, it actually weakens me in the long run and make me what I am today. An absolutely timid and spineless man. I hate that it is all happening in my life, and I want it to change no matter what.

I had a vision of a block of steel. It goes to a fiery torch, and later pounded to bits by a huge hammer. The process goes on and on until it is shaped like a blade. A truly fine work of an artisan. Such as that, it is impossible for anyone to not go through the hard way of living, no matter what they do. Or to be more precise, it is impossible for anyone to go to a place that is worth going without going through the fiery ordeal that it requires.

"Let the fiery path mold me into a sharp sword."

I have understood how difficult life is. It's not like I haven't understand it yet. But I have mistaken my acceptance to it as a license to take it easier. Thinking that even if I'm taking it easier, I would still get something going on.

However, it is so far from the truth. On the happenstances that I live the day seriously, I always realize the gulf that is separating me from where I want to be. Whenever I finish one feature of my project, I realize how far my project is from my vision. Whenever I read a few page of programming books, I realize how far I am from where I want to be in this field. There is simply too much things to do and things to learn that my whole lifetime is not even a drop enough to tackle it all.

Despite everything, I want to live it my all. In order for me to do such a thing, to enter said fiery path is nothing short of mandatory for me. I have chosen to do it the hard way. In the world where people cheat their way to worldly successes, I want to be genuine in my effort. I want to get my hands dirty, learning the craft from the ground up. I want to fail a ton of time in order for me to learn more about it. I want to fall to ground because of my failures, so that I can learn how to stand back up and thicken my skin from there on. I want to live a genuine, wholehearted life, where I don't cheat my way, and leave a long-lasting memory in my old days, and hopefully to other people as well.

In order for me to do all of that, again, there is no way but to enter the arduous and fiery path. Therefore, I need to aim for the impossible.

I will forsake the realistic goal that I've been striving to think about in order for me to be gentle with myself. Goals are not something to think about too much. Goals have always been a way to determine direction as to which one has to go. Goals are not about achieving it and be glorious at the end of it. What's more important from setting ourselves on something is so that we can live it every day and consistently grind ourselves to *go in that direction.* Yes, it is good if you achieve your goals. However, you will soon realize that the glory in which you get will stick for no longer than a minute compared to the habits that you have developed as you look back on the path which you have walked on. 

In the end, you shall realize that the habits that you do every day is so much more precious than a momentary glory when you take the finish line. That even after you have finished your goal, you will still carry on the same habits long into the future.

I won't be too intricate with setting goals myself. I have a vision to finish StudioYosepRA, and a few other projects in a time span of nothing longer than 2 months. I will utilize [*ClickUp*](https://clickup.com/) to manage the tasks. I will not scrutinize on what tasks that I should do 100 kilometers away from where I am. I will only determine the task as far as I can see and manage to do, and determine the next set of tasks when I'm done with what I have on the plate. For example, instead of breaking the front-end tasks into:

- Project research
- Feature planning
- UI references
- UI mockups
- Project dev environment setup
- *etc.*

Instead of that, I would only settle on perhaps the first two steps of the same list. The list above is not the best example I have as I can go even further beyond with breaking each tasks into a series of subtasks itself. So much that I would spend almost a full day just to scrutinize everything that I "need" to do at any moment. And to find out that the seemingly comprehensive plan would fall once one odd factor come into the board and destroy everything as I would often need to readjust the planning over and again.

As stated above, I will keep goal setting a simple process. However, the density of the goal will be a magnitude higher. I will set an unrealistic deadline according to my standards. Say for example, if I think a task would finish in a week in my normal pace, I would push it to 3 days instead. This will help me understand where my limits are. Although, it will be important for me to tough it up because I would stumble a lot and miss the deadlines many times. However again, what's important is not to finish the task alone, but to develop a habit of pushing myself every day to my limit, and face the impossible tasks head-on.

The other important part of developing this habit is time. I must be more strict with the time slots of the day. *Work hard, play hard.* When it's time to work, work yourself to the ground. When it's time to play, play to your heart's content. There will be time for me to work, and also time for me to rest and play. I must respect these time slots that I will set for myself. Because when I work myself to the ground, then I deserve to play to my heart's content. This one is a simple rule, yet it is something that I fail to respect many times before. As for the tools, I would only need an alarm clock that is set at a certain time of the day to signifies when to work and play.

That's it for my plan to get into the habit of aiming for the impossible, so that I may have direction in my life. Here is the summarization for a quick read:

- I will set simple goals that is no further than my arm's reach.
- I will set an unrealistic deadline for said goals.
- I will determine time to work and to play, and dedicate myself to respect those time spaces.
