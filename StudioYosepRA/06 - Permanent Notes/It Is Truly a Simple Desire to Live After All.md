Human is such a fearful being. When they have an option to step forward, they choose to sit down. When they have an idea to solve a problem which their community is facing, they choose to stay quiet. When they know that they have to take the next step in life, they choose the comfort of what is familiar to them. In every step they take, it's difficult to not feel fear of the uncertain tomorrow. Be it its rewards or consequences. And today, they too choose to sit down and be quiet.

It has been about two weeks since I apply a new habit in my daily life. I no longer pray, in a sense that I ask anything from God. I can still say my gratitude, so it's not like my faith is ever weakened. However, I've come to accept, perhaps finally, that God's will is the best. Whatever He wants to do in my life, then it is the best for me. I've come to accept a life where I can be a successful person, and I've come to accept a life where I live like a loser dog. If my Lord sees it as good, then be it as He wills.

It may sound like I have given up on life, and from here on, I would only live it as it flows, without criticism or judgement. However, that is not the case at all. Now that I have surrendered to God's will in my life, I can now focus on doing _what I can actually do._ What I can do is:

- Live a righteous and noble life. As He wills it.
- Do good works.

It is true that I have accepted the best and the worst that could happen to me. Although it is likely that I could slip up and resent my Lord for giving me a hard time. But, I will do my best to remind myself of His will, and do what I can to keep on moving forward.

I see for myself a life of an unassuming person. This person is chock full of anxiety and fear. Whatever he faces in life, he faces it with fear. Even if he choose to do a difficult task, he does it with fearing the possibility of failures. In the end, he couldn't do much in his job, and it ends up okay at best. After finishing his job, again, he is full of regret while he is laying down on his bed. He knows that he didn't do his best, but he also believes that he couldn't do much more as he rationalize his fear of failure. He sleeps at night, and wake up tomorrow to face yet again another fear.

Life is indeed chock full of fear. We can fear about anything we could imagine. If we so desire, we can choose to list out our fears that no amount of ink and paper would suffice. However! However... Despite all of our fears, what we can actually do at the end of it all is to live up our best and soar to the sky like a proud  burning flame.

After I surrendered myself to God's wills, I put myself more on my works. I have a path to become a master software engineer. I don't see this path or way of life in any romantic way such as this is the only way I can live, or if I can't become great as a software engineer, then I would rather die. No... The feeling is much simpler than that. It's just my honest feeling that it is truly possible for me to pour my heart and soul into software engineering, and creative works in general. So much that I can imagine myself doing this until the end of my life, and I would still have so much more things left to do.

From there on, I restart my journey on this path as a web developer. I'm still taking my baby steps by reading books, articles, and tutorials. However, it won't be long before I go back on actually being creative and build some projects. It's fair to say that I no longer feel worried. Whether it comes good, whether I can find jobs, or whether it can be worthwhile or meaningful. All I know is just a question and an answer. If I can so choose to live my life for today, what would I do? Simple answer, I would write code.

The more I work and walk every day, the more I realize what true providence is. The more I work, the more problems I encounter. The more problems I encounter, the more doors and opportunities I find. The more doors there are, the more choice for me to open it. And once I open a few of those doors, my world widen.

When I encounter a problem, I get questions. Once I get questions, I get curious. As my curiosity leads me forward, I see new sceneries. It hasn't been a smooth sailing, that's for sure. But I can feel that *help is there for those who needs it.* Somehow I found a solution written on a blog post. Somehow I struck on a connection that gives me a *Eureka* moment. Somehow I found new doors that leads me to even a bigger question and an even more exciting journey. The help is always there for those who needs it. This is the true form of providence. It comes from God, and not from whatever this Mammon world can give you.

Finally I understand... That no matter how anxious and fearful I may be, what I can do in the end, and the best option possible for me to take, is to always have faith in God and soar myself to the sky. I understand that doing my best is never about using whatever abilities and thrive, as in trying to prove a point to the world. But instead, doing my best is to have faith in God and live.

I realize that my daily works have become my wish and prayer to God. As I continue working, I continue to receive helps from Him. And what I work on every day have become my simple desire to live. 

My decision to surrender myself to God's will, focus on living righteously, and do good works daily makes me realize that a desire has formed in my heart. A simple, mundane, yet serene desire. It is a desire for me to live.
