Knowledge comes from welcoming the unknown. Welcoming the unknown means that we have to brace the discomfort of new knowledge which challenges what we know and understand at the moment as truth. Those new knowledge would often shake what we know now from its foundation, as we continue to ponder and question it further.

Bracing the unknown is always a risky task. At one point, you would find an interesting discovery that leads to a crucial breakthrough. At yet another one, you would open the Pandora's box that leads to diseases and cultural suicides. We will never have the guarantee of always gaining wisdom from our courage to get out of our comfort zone and face the unknown.

Personally, as I'm writing this, I'm very much conflicted about open-mindedness. I understand very much that it's important to always seek new knowledge and reach as far and wide to gain more of it. Not only does it help me have a glance of many other fields of knowledge, it also helps me to understand a bit more about people's perspective in that respective fields. Ultimately, new knowledge will inevitably mingle with old ones, and our brain struck an insight from the connection between these clusters of knowledge, that's when the *eureka* moment shall arrive.

On the other hand, I also understand how dangerous curiosity and open-mindedness can be. Too dangerous that it's stupidly easy for us all to perceive whatever is coming to our brain, whatever is challenging our current knowledge, as the truth itself. Even more true than what you know that you are willing to ditch your old knowledge to embrace the new one.

My conflicted feelings come from this thin and delicate line between these two set of values. As I said before, we can either find a valuable insight or we can open the Pandora's box. I'm not so naïve to believe that I can predict what shall come after I welcome a new knowledge and dig it further. It's a question akin to one about what will happen after we jump into blackhole. Some people believe that it will lead us to another dimension or quantum reality as the space within it continually shrinks. Yet some other people also believe that the blackhole will simply crush our existence out to nothingness and our energy residue will become one with the blackhole.

Both of these theories of blackhole make sense to a certain degree. But the truth remains for us all to see in our seemingly futile argument. *We will never know unless we enter it.*

It goes the same with the concept of open-mindedness to knowledge. We can only know whether we find jewels or calamities once we enter it and explore enough of it. The next question then comes, when should we pull out when we realize that we are heading to a calamitous outcome? The simple answer of this is, of course, once we have gathered enough facts and insights to make an informed and intellectual conclusion to the new knowledge that we have had the courage to explore. This is the responsibility of the explorers and their due diligence. Sadly so, we can only rely on the fragile human soul of the brave explorers to make said judgement.

However, I still think that there are factors to help us determine whether the unknowns are worth exploring. It all depends on one's set of principles. A set of values that one is unwilling to bend, or can also be shallowly called one's set of biases. For instance, I would never entertain a topic about Satanism or homosexuality. If, by chance, those topics appear in my news feed, I would block it, quickly and without hesitation. As per western cultural standard in 2024, I may be called a bigot for not accepting homosexuality. This may be a topic for another note or a branch of topic, but simply put, feel free to call me so if it makes them happy. It's not like I don't accept homosexual people and treat them as inhuman, I detest the sin that they are committing. There are a clear line between sin and sinners. 

Once again, these are the values that I'm not willing to be open-minded to. I believe, nay, I *know* that each person has their own set of principles which they are willing to defend, even alone. And these principles are what I rely on to keep my open-mindedness at bay, at least away from topics that I *know* to be harmful, not only to me, but also the whole humanity and our relationship with God.

To conclude it all. Yes, it's crucial for us all to be open-minded. Not only does it widen your knowledge, but it will also give you a chance to discover great insights from it. But at the same time, we have to do our own due diligence to decide whether we should further entertain our curiosity once we gather enough facts. The great yardstick for that shall be one's own principles, and also the objective truth of humanity, the inherent truth that we all hold as a creation of God since the beginning of time.
