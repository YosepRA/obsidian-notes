It has been a rough past few weeks for me. No, nothing bad necessarily happen, and I'm grateful for that. It's about my deteriorating mental health. I couldn't bring myself to do anything with my life, even to the point of asking myself whether I still want to live at all. I know that this can't continue to go on and I need to get a hang of myself and my life. However, everything feels like a drag. Continuing on to work on my project requires too much suffering. Even writing this post feels unwieldy to my heart.

I really don't know what is wrong with me. I know all the wisdom necessary to conclude that I just need to start the work, keep walking, and have faith in God for anything that may come. However, I just seem to be unable to write the first letter on the paper, the first stroke to the canvas, or the first line of code to my app. Everything feels so heavy. Way too heavy that all I can do is crawl desperately on the ground just to get through the day. And sadly, I also sometimes thought why my life hasn't ended yet as I continue my useless existence of life that continue to bring shame not only to myself, but also my family, and most importantly, my Lord and my God, Jesus Christ.

Despite all of these internal turbulence that are happening in my head, I'm grateful that the thought to "end it all" has never crossed my mind. I thank my Lord for keeping me away from those thoughts. Instead, there is always this urge for me to write. Anything at all. Whether it can be things that happen on the day, or perhaps something similar to this post where I pity-party to whoever is reading. Anything, write anything every day for a short time. This post is my attempt to write and let whatever is occurring in my head to flow.

So, what am I thinking? As the title stated, I'm thinking about detaching myself to the works that I do.

I rarely realize how much I care about my works. I want to do my best in my works, so that I can live a full life to honor my Lord who has given me this life. However, I realize that I confuse the meaning of "doing my best" and "producing a perfect work." 

Never in my life do I ever acknowledge any of men's work to be perfect. For there is only One who is capable of perfection, and that is God. I thought I understand this well enough to not get trapped in the chase of perfection. However, unconsciously, I believe that the only good works are the perfect ones. If it's not perfect, then it is not worthy of being called a good work.

Now that I've written it, I can see how sad it is. Honestly, I still don't know exactly how to handle this. My best answer is always to just start working, keep on walking, and trust the Lord for the outcome. And I think, it is still the best answer there is.

Then, a question dawned on me. Is my eagerness to do my best has become a burden from doing my work? What if I just *don't* do my best? What if I detach myself from whatever I'm working, especially the results and whatever effects it may have to those outside me? What if I don't put my heart into my works and just be willing to be present and persist through the process every day? What if I say "I don't care about however it may turn out to be"? What if I just focus on producing as much works as possible without any care about anything at all?

There are still many more questions of similar nature. But, the basis of all these questions are the same, should I just not care at all? Especially when it comes to the results.

See, I'm always worried with how my works turn out to be. Will it be good enough that I can show it to other people? Will it be useful and make someone's life a bit easier? Will I be proud of it? As I work, these questions continue to crowd my mind as they become hindrances. Sadly, despite my best effort, I couldn't do anything to answer "No" to most of these questions. No, it is likely not be good enough that I can show it to other people. No, it is likely not to be useful to anyone in this whole wide world. And no, I am most certainly won't be proud of it. Finally, the final statement of it all is "why should I bother continue on working, then?"

Why should I start working if I have known the outcome? Why should I persist and keep on working if I can see the futility of it? Why should I put my faith in God that my work is going to *be something?* Why bother working at all if my the sincerity of my heart will not be rewarded at all?

Right now, I'm uncertain whether I want to live. However, I am most certain that I don't want to die a loser like this. I have been in this conundrum for too long already that all of the wisdom seem insufficient anyway. Then, what should I do? What should I do, Lord? I'm exhausted. I don't want to die like a loser who are wasting your blessings. I want to live a wholehearted life to honor you. But again, I don't know how. I truly do not know how.
