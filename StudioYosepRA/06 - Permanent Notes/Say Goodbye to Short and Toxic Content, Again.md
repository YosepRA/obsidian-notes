I start writing today's morning page too late, I guess. Although actually, I started the day earlier than usual. There were many things that I need to do this morning, such as drying my rice, cleaning my bike, watching Pope Francis visit's TV broadcast here in Indonesia, and I also watched a video about the Shroud of Turin.

Although sadly, I still haven't really get rid of Twitter. Out of habit, once I wake up, I would open up my phone and as naturally I would open Twitter. The thrill of getting the news early in the morning could be fun. But oftentimes, it becomes a burden instead if I read toxic news. 

Well, the solution for this is quite simple indeed. When I wake up, I should fire up another habit to replace the one where I open up my phone. The options for this is for me to get out of the bed right away, pick up my toothbrush, and go brush my teeth and wash my face. After that, I could continue with cleaning my room, and then my morning prayer.

Of course, at this time space, there will be an urge to touch my phone as it serves as my cue to check out what is currently happening. This one is quite tricky. I could quickly charge my phone to stop me from using it. Yeah, I'm still not sure about it.

Now that I think about it, why do I crave my phone that much? The answer for that is of course the easy and cheap entertainment that I could have from platforms such as YouTube and Twitter. This is really a simple problem of instant gratification, which is a type of pleasure that requires little to no effort.

I have expressed my distaste of how short the content on the Internet. Short videos and texts that are popularized by Tiktok and Twitter respectively has truly become a blight to my functioning mind. Having consumed too much of it, I realize that my attention span is getting shorter by day. Thankfully, I'm not a lost cause because I can still see it as a problem. I can still write this much text and put enough focus on my work. I can still read books patiently. Although yes, I must admit that my attention span from reading books has shortened by quite a lot. I can feel that my mind wanders way too often as I read my books.

I have realized it since a long time ago, that the information which I'm getting from platforms such as YouTube and Twitter has been too little compared to my time spent on it, and the amount of negativity that I absorb whenever I read its content. Simply put, it is not worth using those platforms if I truly wish to reach the height of consciousness and intellect, so that I can become a lifelong learner, forever useful to God and community.

Once more, this is a question of commitment and choice. I can only have one or another. I can have a healthy mind and body if I fill it with wisdom from many books. Or I can have a pathetic mind that couldn't even form a string of idea without getting distracted by the noise of the world.

I once reached a conclusion where I can completely abandon Twitter, and use YouTube in moderation. Twitter is such a lost cause of a community that it serves as no more than toxic garbage. Even when I try to influence the algorithm to only give me good news, the bad ones continues to flood my feed, too much for a healthy mind can handle. However for YouTube, the good and useful content are still there. The programming tutorial and news are always useful. And there is also news about the games which I played, just enough information to keep myself up to date.

Therefore, it is time for me to recommit to this decision. Thank you for reading.
