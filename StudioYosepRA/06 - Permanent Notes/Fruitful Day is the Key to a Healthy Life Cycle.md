I feel rather good today. Not perfect, but a lot better than usual. My activities were a bit more fruitful yesterday. Though I spent a great deal of it solving the Webpack `publicPath` problem, but it was a well-spent problem solving session. Come evening, I also felt tired enough that I feel sleepy at 23:00, which is the time I set myself to sleep. Actually, I feared that I won't be able to wake up fresh this morning because I was yet again trapped in the blackhole that is my phone, and I stayed up until almost 1:00. On the contrary, I woke up at around 5:00 without an alarm before I snoozed up again and wake up at 6:00 instead.

To say the least, they're good signs that I'm getting my life back in order. I would say the key for that is to have an exhausting day. Facing a problem which shouldn't be one to begin with took a great toll to my mind. The time that I could've used to study the book that I was reading yesterday, *You Don't Know JS*, was derailed by Webpack problem. But what can I say? I want to know about the tools that I'm using in my development. And in order to do that, I need to spend time and effort to learn its peculiarities so that I can make these tools mine. In the end, it was worth it.

The agenda for today is still to read *You Don't Know JS*. I just don't feel like finishing my personal website right now. I will come back to it with much better rhythm sooner or later. But now, I need to get this software development habit going first by reading books and following video tutorials consistently every day. Once I get this ball rolling, I can then challenge "building projects" training regime.

Yeah. There are simply a lot that I want to learn. I have a list of books that I want to read in order to strengthen my core as a developer. I am so far away from where I want to be. But I will try to not be discouraged and keep on walking.
