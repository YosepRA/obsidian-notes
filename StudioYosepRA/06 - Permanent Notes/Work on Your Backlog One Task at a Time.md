Lately, I've returned to this state of not knowing where to go, or even I don't know whether I'm going somewhere or not. This is a state of pure uncertainties. I don't know if turning left or right, going forward or backwards would lead me anywhere. No matter what I conjure in my mind, I couldn't put myself to know where I should or want to go. At least, I haven't found something that will propel my heart to leap to the sky.

It is not that I lack any desire to live at all. It's just that what I desire is not enough to burn my hearts off so that I can charge forward without a slight of fear. At most extent, I have accepted the fact that it is unwise to spend too much time overthinking about the so called "passion" of life. For me, to have any desire that can help me to continue on walking every day is enough.

That's it, I want to keep on walking. At least, by continue on walking, I would go somewhere and reach some place. Perhaps, that place would surprise me as well. Compared to standing still like I do right now, where it is certain that I will never go anywhere or reach any place, continue on walking is a much wiser thing to do.

I don't lack any desire at all. In fact, I do have some. My general desire that is still resonate with my heart is to live a life full of creativity. I want to spend my daily life by being creative. I would create because either I see a need for it, or that I am capable of serve others through my creations. But most importantly, God is the Creator. Since I'm a human made in His image, then being creative is just one inherent trait from Him.

According to this desire, I already have a backlog of what I want to do which I wrote using a web app called ClickUp. This backlog consists of a list of topics that I want to learn or projects that I want to build. There are quite a few of it already that is basically waiting in the dust for me to work on. So, "keep on walking" for me should be all about listing things that I want to learn and projects that I want to build into this backlog, then I should work on it one task at a time, with patient and persistent heart. As I build up more tasks to work on, and more task I have finish, it's going to form steps in my life as I continue on walking.

By doing these tasks, I still don't have any wish to find out that *one glamorous task* that will burn a passionate fire in my heart. Because again, I simply want to keep on walking and go somewhere to some place. By working on these tasks, it will become my proof of my desire to continue on living and walking. Then at some point in life, I would look back at my steps and I would say to myself, that even when I don't know where to go, I have walked this far and I have found some interesting places along the way. And I would be content with that.

The task for today is to continue on building StudioYosepRA, my personal website to showcase my web development journey. Let's continue on walking with that.
