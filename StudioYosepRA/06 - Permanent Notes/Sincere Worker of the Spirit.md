Can you draw a picture for me of a working man who is doing his works with a sincere and peaceful heart? He is occupied in his works as he dedicates his mind and body. He is so absorbed in his work that no other thoughts than what is necessary is filling his heart and mind. It was as if no fire or wind could topple him. For he is simply listening to the Spirit and do the works that is required of him, with an utmost sincerity in his heart.

There are a lot of things that I want to do, I can do, and I need to do. So much that this whole life time isn't nearly enough to even fill a single bucket. I know that I have the blessings of my Lord to do these things, for it is aligned with His will and what I wish to do is good in His eyes. There is literally no friction in my heart between my wishes and His will. Moreover, He is willing to empower me to do my works. Therefore, I no longer need to worry about whether I'm capable of doing my works or not. All I need to do is to be present, open my ear to His voice, and willingly do the work.

With all that in mind, what more excuses do I need to procrastinate on doing my works? Right, none! So why am I stuttering with my steps?

As I dig through my heart, I found out yet again that I'm crippled with worries of the world. It seems that I haven't thoroughly understand when my Lord says that I don't need to worry about anything. Just like in The Parable of the Sower ([Matthew 13](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.13.NKJV)), the worries of the world is like a thorn which is choking those who understand the Word, making them unable to grow and be fruitful.

I may not consciously thinking about my worries as I go through. But unconsciously, I can feel the weight of it. And these worries have affected how I go through my works as it transforms into plain procrastination and laziness. 

Whenever I'm thinking about working on my project for the day, I would unconsciously think of the futility of the work, in a sense that I dread the possibility that my works will never be useful for anyone or myself. The consciously, these deep feelings are transformed into laziness and slothfulness of actions, where neither do I put enough effort to it, or none at all.

This excruciatingly painful of a deathly cycle. Would it be a whole lot better if I can not care about the worries at all, and put my whole being into the works that are needed to be done? 

The image of a man who is working sincerely with his heart always surfaces in my mind. This man simply doesn't care about the worries of the world, not because he is ignorant of it, or is he deliberately underestimate it, but because he put his absolute trust in the Lord. For he *knows* the Lord desires for him to live, he knows the Lord desires for him do the work that is required of him, and the most important part, he knows the Lord desires for him to **be fruitful**. This man sees all of these works not as a burden or a chore, but rather an **honor** because the Spirit of God is willing to use his humble life as a vessel for God's will.

What more honor can a man ask than God's willingness to work together with him? Right, no amount of honor could surpass it. No worldly riches will ever be enough for this honor.

That is why, please listen to the Spirit, for He is willing to speak with you and work with you. Let Him guide your life so that your life be fruitful. Let Him be the beacon of light so that you can honor the Father and your fruits may please Him and be helpful to those whom He is willing to share.

It is the greatest honor for man to have the Spirit of God to be willing to work with him.
