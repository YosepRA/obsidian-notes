*Huff...* Honestly, I've run out of juice to write anything today. I've spent everything into *Variable Declaration Compilation in JavaScript* note below. Therefore, I apologize if I talk rambles for about 15 minutes from now.

Today, I continue with my reading *You Don't Know JS* by Kyle Simpson. I've arrived at the volume 2 of the book series titled *Scope & Closure.* Mr. Simpson explains how JavaScript does its thing with maintaining the scope and how the program knows whether variable `a` has a value or not. And if there is a value assigned to `a`, then the program could use it for whatever it wants.

What is challenging about reading technical books such as this is how to retain the knowledge gained from it. From reading it alone, I could roughly understand it. However, if left alone, it isn't rare for me to forget it only a week later. That's why, it's important for me to study it properly. And when I'm saying "properly," I mean writing notes about it. That is where my habit to write mini-essays comes through using Obsidian Notes app.

The thing is, writing about technical topics can be an exhausting process. No, I'm not moaning about how difficult it is. If anything, I enjoy it a lot! I guess, as always, when it comes to doing difficult stuff like this, I'm worried about the time it requires me to do it.

To write the notes today, it took me at least 1 hour to write it. I'm conflicted. About 90% of my existence enjoyed my process of seriously reading a book and writing what I've learned in my own language. And I understand that writing these notes were worth it for me. However, there is a slight worry that I may have used too much time to elaborate on what I've been studying at any given time. 

However also, I can see that these worries are a complete nonsense. I know it very well what it takes for anyone to master a skill. I have everything in this world that God has given me to study seriously. And I think it's unwise for me to worry about petty things such as time, which is a commodity that is given by God for my needs also.

I know that this is an arduous road to walk on. But, this is the path that I have chosen, and this is the path which God has allowed me to walk on. I will hold my faith to God. Ultimately, I will do so. Therefore, I shall not worry about time and immerse myself in this journey, so that I can gain meaningful things along the way.

Thank you for reading. Have a good day.
