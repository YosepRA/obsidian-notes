This is the second day in a row of writing morning pages. As you may have seen from the time stamp above, I'm way too late to start the day. Unfortunately, I'm still unable to get rid of Twitter and social media from my morning schedule.

I woke up at 6:30, which is quite late for my standard. In my good days, I would wake up at 5:00 without an alarm. Right now, it's 6:30 at the latest without an alarm as well. This is all due to my sleeping cycle that makes me feel sleepy as late as 1:00 in the morning, while ideally, I would love to feel sleepy as late as 23:00.

There is a charm with having a natural sleeping cycle without forced awakening from an alarm clock. The good feeling of sleepiness and waking at the right time can be a determining factor between a healthy and energized body and the groggy ones.

There are many factors as to why this happens to me. But mainly, when it's time for me to start to get myself sleepy, I would often open up my phone to check out on the social media. When 23:00 is supposed to be the time when I would start feeling sleepy, I would instead *delay* my sleepy time by opening up my phone. In the end, the time is stretched to as late as 1:00 when it has become way too late for me to sleep healthily.

One other factor is perhaps the lack of activities that I do in a day. See, when we are feeling exhausted because of good works, our mind and body would naturally feel a need to sleep. So, the act of sleeping won't become an act where we consciously tell our body to sleep. Once we are tired, take our bath, eat our dinner, and fall to our bed, we would sleep in an instant.

Sadly enough, I haven't been spending my days with enough works to drive me to a healthy life cycle. And that is what I'm willing to do. Doing things such as fixing my sleeping cycle and doing more work in the day are one of the first and fundamental parts of leading a healthy life. From then on, I could add an exercise regiment and a simple healthy diet.

Actually, I remember that I've made a daily schedule listing a daily routine according to specific timestamps, such as I would wake up at 5:00 and start cleaning up my room right away. Then, the work starts at 6:30 when I've finished with cleaning up and prayer. There are time blocks to take a nap and leisure gaming sessions too. I've found the Word document for this schedule in my hard drive, and the more I see this schedule, I wonder to myself "why haven't I follow this healthy schedule?"

Right after writing this morning page entry, I will revisit this document to adjust my daily schedule. Even I just came up with an idea to create an app for me to constantly monitor what time is it and what kind of activities I should be doing, haha.

Yes. Following this schedule should have been my first steps in gaining order in my life. Although yes, the days of our life is dynamic, and it couldn't be controlled by a strict daily routine no matter how detailed these plans are. However, to have daily schedule such as this as the main baseline could serve as an important fundamentals of my daily activities.

I will address this matter about daily schedule and natural sleeping cycle right away. Thank you for reading.
