Problem solving is one of the most basic and vital skill to have and hone in our life. Without the knowledge on how to approach a problem at hand, it can be easy for us to get intimidated by it on first sight, while the truth is you are capable of solving it. Sure, this wisdom can only come from experience of facing many hardships in our life, but it's always good to notice a few parts that makes the whole invaluable skill that is problem solving. And that is about *asking a good question.*

Whenever we think about solving a problem, we would often think about *how* to solve said problem. And other people will also praise the end result when the problem is finally solved. However, we often ignore what comes before the solution, how can we arrive at that answer for the problem? It's because we managed to find the good and correct question.

Having a bad question will inevitably lead to bad answers too. I've learned this the hard way in my journey as a web developer. I didn't remember which one it was, but it's certain that I did the same mistake of having bad questions multiple times already. Although it wasn't that fatal of a mistake, but I still learned my lessons from it.

On the other hand, whenever I managed to find the correct question of a problem is when I feel as if the puzzle pieces are fit perfectly. Because once I find the correct question, the rest of formulating the answer to said question becomes formality as it was only a matter of time before I can arrive at a proper enough answer. From there on, it was only a matter of refining the answers that I came up with.

Such example between good and bad question. Imagine you find a 10 cm hole down the road. This road is often passed by people in their daily walk. And it's easy for people to trip on this hole if they don't pay enough attention to the road. It's certainly a problem that is asking to be solved, isn't it? So let's ask our questions. Which one of these is the correct question?

1. How can this hole exist in the first place?
2. What can I do to stop people from tripping up from this hole?

The correct question is the second one, for a very obvious reason. It's too late to ask as to why such hole can form in the first place, and it's more productive to ask the second question to provide an immediate solution. That is not to say that the first question isn't valid, not at all. There may be time to ask such question once we help stopping people from tripping up.

This may not be the most comprehensive example that I can provide. Because oftentimes, bad questions can disguise themselves as good questions. You can only realize it when you've walked far enough to giving an answer that you doubt your initial question, whether it was the correct question after all. Again, this intuition can only come with experience as you face many different problems and make an effort to solve it.

That being said, finding good questions is arguably much more important than providing the answer. And finding such good questions can only come from life experience as you face many problems in life. However, you shouldn't wait for problem to arrive on your plate before you practice this invaluable skill. 

Problem is in every place you can lay your eyes on. All you need to do is to *explore it,* be curious about the world around you. One way to spark and nurture that curiosity is by studying. Read books, write it down, and accumulate those writings over time. As you read and write more, your knowledge and experience will grow. Before you know it, you will have a mountain of knowledge inside your head. Because there will be a time later in the future when you are thankful for this mountain of knowledge because it will help your future self in their endeavor to find the correct question. 

How can your future self arrive at the good question? Yes, because he already experienced it before.
