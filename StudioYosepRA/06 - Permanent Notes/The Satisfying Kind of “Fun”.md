Life is supposed to be fun. God desires for us His creation to have fun and enjoy being alive. Even in the world where suffering is the easiest thing we can see, and as much logical arguments you may say that having fun is for those who have the privilege, we deserve to have a fun and enjoyable life.

There are many definitions of fun for each persons. Some may have fun when they play in nature, some perhaps enjoy reading more, yet another may enjoy "fooling around" at night, and yet some may also have fun when they hurt themselves. Each and every one of us have our definition of fun, starting from a totally wholesome one, to the ones that are simply questionable or plainly gruesome, at least for myself. But again, all of us have our own ways to have fun, and we also believe that we genuinely have fun doing such activities.

However, there is one kind of fun. The one, which I think we all can agree on, that fills our heart and soul. The kind of fun that leaves the feeling of utter gratitude because we choose to go on with it. The one that leaves us with no feeling of regret or guilt. The kind of fun which I may call *satisfying.*

There are a few criteria of defining satisfying fun:
- It demands patience.
- It doesn't come easily.
- The reward doesn't come early.
- We don't feel guilty to spend too much time on it.
- It brings us good sleep at night.

Notice that I didn't mention something about "working hard on it". While I understand that some of the satisfying fun may require some real effort, but the common image in our head when it comes to hard work is working day and night, having unpaid overtime, and getting real bad fever and stomach ache at the end of the week. As much as it's sadly a norm in some part of the world, and some people can only live like that, but not one of us ever wish that we need to live our life until the day we leave this world. However, the effort that is sometime required by satisfying fun doesn't require us to torture ourselves and make us regret life in such ways.

Alas, most of the fun of today is far away from being satisfying. An easy example for that would be social media. The entertainment that comes from social media is very easy to get. All you have to do is open one of your device and open the app of your choosing. From there on, you can just not be mindful of what exactly you want to be entertained of, and you would easily spend (or skip) hours having fun. 

In many senses, it's funny, because it reminds me of a time machine. Whenever we need to pass the time, we can quickly fire up our social media, and voila, hours would pass just like that. We do indeed had fun while scrolling through our phones. However, we also have to admit that the feeling left after closing the phone after that is an unpleasant drowsiness. It's often hard to optimally do whatever we need to do afterwards. Heck, we often would no longer have the willpower to do difficult things as our "fun time" has depleted all of our attention and focus.

It has been almost 2 weeks since the last time I opened social media, mainly YouTube and Twitter. The reason for me not opening social media is not that I make myself a commitment to not open social media, but rather simply because I don't want to get spoiled by the story of a game that I play.

One thing that I quickly notice after I stop opening social media is that my time opens up. The time that was once used to be filled with endless scrolling has now become open to fill with something else. Moreover, the amount of time that opens up is simply huge. I can say 2 hours in the morning, another 1 hour at noon, and perhaps the sum about 3 to 4 hours around evening. Those are just rough estimation, but it shouldn't be too far away because of my daily schedule. But yes, it's a lot of time for me to use social media.

Consciously, I understand that I've been using a lot of time on social media. But I never pay attention exactly of much time do I really spend on it. Only once I chose, albeit accidently, to not open social media do I finally realize. Now left with so much time on my daily life, I'm ironically confused with how to spend it.

Aside from the time slots opening up on my schedule, I also realize how bored I am. Sure, I still have the agitation of opening up my phone every now and then. But my desire to avoid game story spoilers triumphs in my heart, so the temptation isn't that strong. With so much time at hand, I've been doing more writing notes like this one or read fictional novels.

The reason why I'm writing this note is because I simply got bored as I want to dig into my heart the meaning of fun activities. Since said fun activities' definition is no longer aligned with instant gratifications provided social media, I'm looking at something more sustainable and enduring. Then I found the term of fun activities which are satisfying.

Previously in the morning, I wrote about the shortness of life and my laments that I should do what my heart most desired. What my heart desire right now is naturally difficult to achieve. Not difficult in a sense that it brings despair, but rather an understanding that they are worth doing. 

For instance, I've always wanted to lead a life of creative abundance. I want to spend each and every day being creative, learn new things, and share it with others. This is just a gist of it, but this desire branches towards a lot of things and fields of creativity, such as engineering, art, and music. I realized that there are a bunch of things that my heart desires. But I also realize that these activities is, in essence, a contrast difference than what I've been doing so far.

Living a creative life requires an immense amount of patience of time and effort. Moreover, I shouldn't expect the same reward that I've been having from consuming many sorts of content from social media out there. There will be a lot more time that requires me to endure, and there will be time when I need to tell myself to keep on going. It's going to be a much more difficult endeavor of *having fun* compared to before. But deep inside, my heart is sincerely telling me that it's going to be worth it. So worth it that I wouldn't trade it with anything in this world.

As I imagine myself spending more time building more apps, studying how to draw and draw illustrations, or how to play my guitar, I imagine how *satisfying* those activities would be. Again, the different kind of fun that is often provided by today's social media culture. As I ponder more about the meaning of the word *satisfying,* I wrote this note.

Honestly, I don't know if I have done a good job explaining about this idea about *satisfying fun.* So if you find yourself reading this and scratching your head, I apologize. As for social media, I plan on stop using Twitter for good. But for YouTube, I will be more disciplined with what kind of content and how much time I could spend on it.

Oh well... My life is about to get a bit more "difficult". But I'm willing to do it. Because it's going to be worth it.
